As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus. Slightly embarrassed and with quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't! So, little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt little more and for second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. With coy little smile to the driver, she again unzipped the offending skirt to give little more slack and again was unable to make the step. Aboutthis time, big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, How dare you touch my body!! don't even know who you are!	Atthis, the Texan drawled, Well ma'am normally would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, kinda figured that we was friends.

An elderly woman walked into the Royal Bank of Ireland one morning with purse full of money. .  She wanted to open savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had lot of money.

The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'. The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money The elderly woman replied that she made bets. The president was surprised and asked, kind of bets?' The elderly woman replied, bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.' The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win bet like that. The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, you like to take my bet?' replied the president. bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.' the elderly woman answered. given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind would like to come back at 10 clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as witness.' problem', said the president of the Bank confidently. That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that way, up and down, turned it around, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet. The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly. The president was happy to oblige. The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the president if she could touch them. course', said the president. the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.' The elderly woman did so with little smile.	Suddenly the president noticed that the \*lawyer was banging his head against the wall.\* He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, it's probably because bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock this morning would be holding the balls of the President of the Royal Bank of Ireland

Little Bobby was running through the woods .  Little Bobby was running through the woods behind his house when the urge to go #2 struck. Bobby did his business behind tree and carried on his way. The next day, Bobby was out behind his house again when he saw swarm of flies circling yesterday's droppings. Intrigued, Bobby dropped his pants and did his business in the exact same spot in hopes of seeing how many flies he could gather. After couple weeks of doing this, Bobby had created rather tall pile of dung. So tall, in fact, that he now needed to use step ladder to make sure he had stable poo-pole developing. curious neighbor caught sight of Bobby doing this, and after confronting Bobby, the neighbor punched Bobby in the face and told him to grow the hell up. Over the next few days, word of Bobby's droppings had spread around town. It started with just few people day coming up to Bobby, punching him in the face, and telling him the errs of his way. It wasn't long until there was line of over 50 people waiting to see Bobby's poo-pole and to subsequently punch him in the face. The line moved pretty slowly, however, and someone towards the back of the line had to take care of some business of his own. Not wanting to leave his spot, he dropped his pants answered nature's call right then and there. The stench of his droppings spread quickly throughout the line. One gentleman towards the front of the line caught its stench when he saw Bobby's creation, admiration spreading across his face.	The man at the front of the line turned around and said that was good shit post, but this punchline stinks.

Afteronly few days he is running the riggin like an old hand, he swabs the decks without complaint and spends his free time in amicable companionship playing cards or telling tall tales. Allin all the young man feels as if he has found his calling. Afew weeks go by like this, the young man loving his new life except one part.. There are no women. Aftercouple of months like this, he is starting to feel extremely uncomfortable with the situation and voices his complaints to his shipmates one evening. Whydon't you just use the barrel?

His days continue as before, and his evenings are still spent in pleasant company, but new addition to his routine is nightly visit to the barrel. Anothertwo months pass in this way and all is well, until one night as he gets up from his seat at the card table and announces that he is going to visit the barrel to his mates.

The young man asks, worry playing over his face.	Notat all mate, it's just that.. next month is your turn in the barrel.

There was this tramp. .  One cold winter's morning he was walking along country road, when he heard cry for help from nearby lake. Withoutmoment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for car to flag down. Coincidentallythe father drives up. How can ever thank you sir? he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. Just name your price I'm wealthy man. Ah,well... stammers the tramp, ... uh, I'm little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out. Ohdear, says the father, don't carry much cash with me, only have ten pounds but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe. No!No! says the tramp, Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life that'll be plenty. Tenpounds, thinks the tramp, I'm rich! I'm rich! and off he goes to the town to buy himself holiday. Hefinds travel agent, walks in much to the disgust of the staff and goes up to the desk. I'll have one holiday please! Ahem,which holiday would sir like? asked the girl at the desk, forcing smile. Oh,any holiday don't mind, anything up to ten pounds, replies the tramp. TENYou'll get holiday for ten pounds, says the girl incredulously. Shegoes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There to her amazement she finds an old file. Wellyou'll never believe it, she says to the tramp, back in the shop. I've got you holiday its super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise and it costs ten pounds. Yippee!exclaims the tramp, I'll take it! Afew days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen. Getoff my ship ye dirty bum! shouts voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside. ButI've got my ticket!, responds the tramp, super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and want on! Wellokay, says the captain, but you can't come on just now, don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then. Sothe tramp finds himself quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep. Psst,says voice, waking him with start. It was the captain. Hurryup, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin. Thetramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship and what ship! Firstthey went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets pile. genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere. Thenthe second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens watertight door into tiny 7' 4' cabin, with hammock, bedside table, and an alarm clock. Sheerluxury! exclaimed the tramp, room of my very own. I'mglad you like it, replies the captain, but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise. Wellthe cruise began, and the tramp had whale of time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen... Thenone morning, week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below. Heclimbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what dive...! Perfectlypoised in the air, he hit the water without so much as ripple. Nowunknown to him, the captain who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp was standing watching this. Thatwas amazing! exclaimed the captain, Where did you learn to dive like that? Um,well I've never actually dived before, replied the tramp. Wellthat's incredible! says the captain, I've never seen... He broke off. Hey, I've got an idea, he started again. How would you like to train bit, and we'll put on show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class! It'sdeal! says our man. For the next weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it. Thenone morning the captain comes to talk. Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next days. We're going to erect high diving board for you. Okay,agreed the tramp. Twodays passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose slender column of metal. Well,tramp, said the captain, shaking his hand, Let's see what you can do. And with that the Captain handed him walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...up and up...below him the ship grew smaller...on and on...past solitary albatross...and still higher...till the ship was but speck on the ocean below...and on still further.../ till the ocean grew dim...and the earth itself...began to shrink...past our moon...and on...and Mars...and on...higher, and higher...through the asteroid belt...and on and on towards the diving board...past the outer planets, until...on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...he reached the board. Heclimbed on top and radioed the captain...and then....' '.. .. .he jumped.....: Slowlyat first,:but speeding up,:::faster, and faster,:speeding past Pluto,:and the other outer planets,.........through the asteroid belt,past Mars,and the moon,faster,and faster,faster ever faster,and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,faster, and faster,past the albatross,double-back somersault,and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet, Downon the ship the crew strained their necks, Iyelled passenger, tramp streaked down towards the pool, did last triple flip, and dove... NOTthe sea bed, sinking 37' shaft in the process. Desperatefor air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface. Upand up, desperate, gasping... Outof the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into throng wild with acclaim. HERO!handing him heated towel the captain spoke, as hush fell over the crowd. Welltramp, have seen anything like that, That was the most piece of diving have ever seen. Thetramp blushed. Thecaptain went on, but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived how did you do it. Andthe tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: Well you see... Forme to tell you, I'll need $49.95 Thecaptain outrageously asked why.

Your .  woman brought very limp duck into veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. Aftermoment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away. Thedistressed woman wailed, Are you sure? Yes,am sure. Your duck is dead, replied the vet.. Howcan you be so sure? she protested.. mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in coma or something. Thevet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned few minutes later with black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. Thevet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. few minutes later he returned with cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

In crowded city at bus stop, beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in tight leather mini skirt, with matching tight leather boots and jacket... .  As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus.

Aboutthis time, big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, How dare you touch my body!! don't even know who you are!

Five friends were sitting around, debating which Pixar movie is the greatest .  After few hours of debate, no one was willing to concede, and it was decided that vote must be held. Unfortunately, with so few friends present, it was clear that they would need to bring the vote to the greater public. The group decided that each friend would make plea to the subreddit of their choice, and whoever received the most karma for it would win. Adam,already undecided himself, decided to go to /r/ AskReddit.He laid out the agreement, and asked that everyone vote one their favorite movie, and the one with the most votes he would use for the his friends. Unfortunately, as the votes were split in that sub, his highest post amounted to mere 38 points. Paul,big proponent for the Toy Story franchise, posted to /r/nostalgia in the hopes that everyone who grew up with Toy Story would agree. Unfortunately, as there had been two sequels (with third on the way) it wasn't exactly considered nostalgia and he got downvoted into oblivion. Bill,who loved Monsters Inc., made his case using some trickery. Going to /r/news, he found seemingly unrelated post, and made top-level comment describing, in great detail, why Monsters Inc. was the greatest film of all time. The fact that the post was so out of context made everyone flock to it, and drew enough attention to new him over thousand fake internet points. Mike,who loved the Incredibles movies, decided to stay in his wheelhouse. Over the course of several hours, he created each of the family members from the Incredibles in Soulcaliber Finally, he photoshopped the family together, and posted it to /r/gaming. Under normal circumstances this would have skyrocketed to the top, but the format was stale, and thus only received 20k karma. Still, Mike was confident in his victory. Whilethe other four friends came up with plans on how to maximize their karma gains, Chris sat silently. For hours he sat, making no posts, coming up with no original content. Finally, an hour before the deadline, he broke into his neighbor's house, stealing his copy of the Pixar movie Up. He took picture of his theft and posted it directly to /r/ Jokeswith the title the group got together the next day to see who got the most votes, everyone was in awe. Chris's post had over 40,000 points. How did you know that would win? Easy, Chris replied.	Everyone knows stolen content on /r/ Jokesgets all the Up votes.

Walking through the forest, an atheist hears rustling in the bushes. Turning, he sees massive grizzly charging towards him! .  He runs as fast as he can but trips over stump and falls. As the bear raises huge paw to strike, the atheist screams: God! Help me! Timefreezes. The bear becomes immobile, the forest is silent, and the river stops running. Then the atheist hears powerful voice: You have denied my existence for years, taught others don't exist and credited my creation to cosmic accident. Why should help you? It would be hypocritical to ask you to show mercy on me, the atheist agrees. But perhaps you could make the bear Christian?	At that, the noise of the forest resumes, the river runs, and the bear drops to its knees, brings its paws together, and says, Lord, for this food which am about to receive, am truly thankful.

Three years ago mistakenly bought my son giant conch shell… .  have son who's on the spectrum. It's quite common for people like him to latch onto one specific topic and become an absolute encyclopedia about it. Some people choose trains, some cartoon. For my son, this was mollusks. Interesting topic know, but it seemed to be pretty good deal for us because it meant he'd get really excited about going outside to the beach which we figured was healthier than staying inside all the time. He'd always have shell with him, or in his pocket. Usually he doesn't want to talk much, but if you opened the conversation to it, he'd sit there rattling off facts about mollusks for hours. This was shaping up to be long term passion, so for his 15th birthday went out and bought him giant conch shell. He absolutely loved it. The texture, holding it to his ear etc. It was too big to carry around with him all the time, but he kept it by his bed. Fast forward three years, this is where things get weird. About month ago was cleaning his room and picked up the conch to dust it off, something I've never actually done before. was immediately hit by terrible smell don't want to get too into the gross details but I'm dude, once 18 year old dude, so know what happens when you use something to masturbate and don't clean it. I'm sure we all know what that smells like even after week. It was pretty clear he had been using this shell as kind of Strombidae fleshlight for long, long time without cleaning it. I'm not going to share too much about what happened when this all came to light, but we tried taking it away and my god you'd think we just took his whole world. We decided to give the shell back, but worried this reflected deeper issue my partner and decided to get some professional help. So it's been about month of him seeing behavioural therapist, and she recently asked me about his progress at home. told her it's been incredibly promising so far.	He's really starting to come out of his shell.

Stoner Joke. Three Men Died and Went to Hell Where They Met the Devil. Long one) .  Three men died and went to hell where they met the Devil. The Devil told them that they had sinned in life and therefore had to spend the next 666 years in hell to atone for their sins. However, since the Devil wasn't entirely merciless, he would let them choose for themselves how they were going to spend those 666 years. And so the Devil let the men to three doors. Goingthrough the first door, they entered what looked to be normal bar. Although, if you were there for more than an hour, you would notice that no matter how much you tried to drink another bottle would appear on the shelf. And even better, the bar always had the exact drink you wanted available. An unlimited supply of every alcoholic beverage in existence. It was, in short, drunkard's paradise. Whenthey entered the second door, they were greeted by myriad of women all ready to satisfy every sexual desire they could possible have. There were multiple women of every shape, size and ethnicity imaginable. Looking closer you would notice that there were even celebrity and work crushes from your life in the crowd. Every single one of them ready to please you. It was, in short, pervert's paradise Finally,when they entered the third door, they found themselves in forest made of cannabis. The ground was made of kief, all the bushes wore beatiful buds and even the trees were 20 feet tall cannabis plants. There were every strain it has or ever will be possible to grow. You could even find rocks of hashish laying around the forest floor if you looked closely. It was, in short, stoner's paradise. TheDevil asked the men which room they each wanted. The words had barely left the Devil's mouth before the first man ran directly to the room with myriad of women. The second man then went to the room with the bar, thinking that if he was going to spend 666 years in hell, he might as well be drunk for most of it. Lastly, the third man, thinking he had won the lottery, gladly went towards the room with the forest of cannabis.666 years later, the Devil returned to see if the men had atoned for their sins. Whenhe opened the first door, bottles slowly rolled out and you could immediately smell piss and puke coming from the room. It took the Devil while, but he finally found the man nestled between the bottles, smeared in his own shit and puke, and with arguably the worst hangover in history. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out. Whenhe opened the second door, he was overwhelmed with the sound of hundreds of crying children and angry women. Not ten seconds after the door opened, the man came running, pleading for the Devil to please let him out. There were kids of every age running around screaming and all the women were angry at each other, while everyone, children and mothers alike, were angry at the man. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out. Whenthe Devil opened the third door, he immediately saw the man sitting cross legged in giant pool of his own tears. The Devil had not expected this. Confused, he went to ask the man what was wrong.	The man, tears still running down his face, looked up at the Devil and said: Idon't have lighter

We're instructed to let you have day in hell and day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you'd like to go for all eternity. Actually,think I'd prefer heaven, said the woman. Sorry, we have rules… at which St. Peter put the manager into the downward bound elevator. Asthe doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto beautiful golf course. In the distance was country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times. Theyplayed perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had wonderful night telling jokes and dancing. Beforeshe knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. Now it's time to spend day in heaven, he said. Soshe spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day's end St. Peter returned. So, he said, You've spent day in hell and you've spent day in heaven. You must choose between the two. Thewoman thought for second and replied: Well, heaven is certainly lovely, but actually had better time in hell. choose Hell. Accordingly,St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her. Idon't understand, stuttered the manager, The other day was here, and there was golf course, and country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had wonderful happy time. Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.	TheDevil simply looked at her and smiled, Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you're staff.

married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. .  Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented new machine that would transfer portion of the mother's labor pain to the father. He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it. Thedoctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. Thedoctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer the pain to him. The wife delivered healthy baby with virtually no pain. She and her husband were ecstatic.	Whenthey got home, the mailman was dead on the porch.

Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch. TheKing, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts.

Thenext day, Horatio slipped massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick. Themoral of the story Pay your bills !	!

So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for living. .  He loved his job. Driving train had been his dream ever since he was child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said failed execution was sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. Theman looked at the executioner and said, Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just bad conductor.

Man wakes up in slum with no memory of how he got there. .  He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is. You'rein the afterlife! he tells the man, But you must have been real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here. Allof sudden, siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. guard in heavy body armor blows whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines. Thebeggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there. Sothe man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's bit below average for real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into familiar former beggar as he crosses the street. Whatare the odds? they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line. The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch. Whilehe's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it! Sadly,this proved not to be true. After only few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in glittering, clean city full of glass and steel. Andwouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. Come, the beggar told him, I'll take you to the evening meal. So the man followed and they entered glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line, and then he added, and apparently here, they change the meals times year! Theman rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for million dollars to pass. Well the man was bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. What is it, he thought, that could possibly be more wonderful than what have here? That question haunted him for weeks until he came to conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring. Fiftyyears later, he returned to the guards with million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same. Thebeggar laughed jovially. got here only three years ago myself, but somehow knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in! Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own. Smilingat the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. That's the line for the dragon meat, he said before turning to the next line, and that's the line for angeldust stew, then he paused, confused. Whatis it? the man asked his old friend.	Thebeggar replied, There appears to be no punchline.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened. Theman was perfectly fine. Well,at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said failed execution was sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. Theswitch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

I'm not giving you thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. Theman looked at the executioner and said Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just bad conductor.

years ago today, shared the worst joke ever created. Here it is again for those that missed it. .  There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted. About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off. The dentist wakes to knock on the door. Suspecting solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; full skeleton underneath tattered cloak. The grim reaper swears. Oh no! This always happens with identical twins. What do you mean? asks the dentist. Well... if you must know, your brother was in critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now. The dentist is noticeably upset. He says Wait! Isn't there some way can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, made the mistake. Certainly there must be way can bargain for his life. The grim reaper asks What do you have in mind? The dentist thinks. How about challenge? If beat you, you let my brother go free. The grim reaper laughs. will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose? The dentist smiles. propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. minutes of brushing each, then we decide. Very well says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom. Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance. The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like madman. When his minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles. It's unbelievable. The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth. The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. You win, human. This time. Your brother will live. He disappears in puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, went out to the market and got hit by car. They say almost died. The dentist smiles on the phone and says. That's interesting, bro.	Today you might say that also had brush with death.

perfectly triangular lake has kingdoms on its sides .  perfectly triangular lake has kingdoms on its sides. The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army. Thekingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets rope and swings it over the branch of tall tree, making noose, and hangs pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up.

Your .  woman brought very limp duck into veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest.

Howcan you be so sure? she protested.. mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in coma or something. Thevet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned few minutes later with black Labrador Retriever.

The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. Thevet looked at the woman and said, I'm sorry, but as said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, dead duck. Thevet turned to his computer terminal, hit few keys and produced bill, which he handed to the woman.. Theduck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. $1,500! she cried,$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead! Thevet shrugged, I'm sorry.	If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500.

politician dies. Instead of going straight to heaven or hell, spirit appears to him. .

Five friends were sitting around, debating which Pixar movie is the greatest .  After few hours of debate, no one was willing to concede, and it was decided that vote must be held. Unfortunately, with so few friends present, it was clear that they would need to bring the vote to the greater public. The group decided that each friend would make plea to the subreddit of their choice, and whoever received the most karma for it would win. Adam,already undecided himself, decided to go to /r/ AskReddit.He laid out the agreement, and asked that everyone vote one their favorite movie, and the one with the most votes he would use for the his friends. Unfortunately, as the votes were split in that sub, his highest post amounted to mere 38 points. Paul,big proponent for the Toy Story franchise, posted to /r/nostalgia in the hopes that everyone who grew up with Toy Story would agree. Unfortunately, as there had been two sequels (with third on the way) it wasn't exactly considered nostalgia and he got downvoted into oblivion. Bill,who loved Monsters Inc., made his case using some trickery. Going to /r/news, he found seemingly unrelated post, and made top-level comment describing, in great detail, why Monsters Inc. was the greatest film of all time. The fact that the post was so out of context made everyone flock to it, and drew enough attention to new him over thousand fake internet points. Mike,who loved the Incredibles movies, decided to stay in his wheelhouse. Over the course of several hours, he created each of the family members from the Incredibles in Soulcaliber Finally, he photoshopped the family together, and posted it to /r/gaming. Under normal circumstances this would have skyrocketed to the top, but the format was stale, and thus only received 20k karma. Still, Mike was confident in his victory. Whilethe other four friends came up with plans on how to maximize their karma gains, Chris sat silently. For hours he sat, making no posts, coming up with no original content. Finally, an hour before the deadline, he broke into his neighbor's house, stealing his copy of the Pixar movie Up. He took picture of his theft and posted it directly to /r/ Jokeswith the title the group got together the next day to see who got the most votes, everyone was in awe. Chris's post had over 40,000 points. How did you know that would win? Easy, Chris replied.	Everyone knows stolen content on /r/ Jokesgets all the Up votes.

Two Aliens .  Two aliens landed in the Arizona desert near gas station that was closed for the night.

Theyounger alien became angry at the lack of response. Theolder alien said, calm down if were you.' Theyounger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response. Pissed at the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said gruffly, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader or will fire! Theolder alien again warned his comrade saying, probably don't want to do that! really think that will make him mad.'' Rubbish,'replied the cocky, young alien. He aimed his weapon and opened fire. There was huge explosion. massive fireball roared towards him and blew the younger alien off his feet and threw him in burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in cactus patch. Halfan hour passed. When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head.' Whatferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien. damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?'	Theolder alien leaned over, placed friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you never mess with guy who can loop his pen!s over his shoulder twice and then stick it in his ear.'

However, they arrived several hours early, and had little to do on Sunday morning while everything was closed. Well,one says to the other, pointing to nearby Cathedral, why don't we attend Mass? Sure,replies his friend. But we don't know how the French pray and we can't speak French! Thefirst guy thinks of solution. We'll pick guy in front of us, and whatever he does, we'll do. Hisfriend agrees. They enter the church, sit close to the front, and choose guy. Fifteenminutes pass, and their plan is working well. Thirty minutes, no issues. Bythe time forty-five minutes pass, they've gotten used to the routine. Suddenly, while everyone is seated, the priest says something in French and the gentleman they chose stands up. Without thinking, the two Americans stand up as well. Thechurch bursts into hard laughter. Realizingthat no one else is standing up, the two American men leave in embarrassment.

Themonks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find door made of ruby. Hedemands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behindthat door is another door, this one made of sapphire. Soit went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally,the monks say, This is the last key to the last door. Theman is relieved to no end. Heunlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.	Butcan't tell you what it is because you're not monk.

Right now, the world leave behind enters revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.- Myconnections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.- Iknow all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you true example of someone who achieved everything that ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation. Thethree people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.- Impossible,yells the 1st person! Such plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?- Who?M-me? only had two part time jobs, nothing else that can remember. During the morning hours worked in small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.- You'rejoking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?- Oh...thatone was bit odd. My village had signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.- Thisis preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?- W-well,don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.	(

Joe was moderately successful in his career, but as he got older he was increasingly hampered by incredible headaches. When his personal hygiene and love life started to suffer, he sought medical help. .  After being referred from one specialist to another, he finally came across doctor who solved the problem. The good news is can cure your headaches; the bad news is that it will require castration. You have very rare condition which causes your testicles to press up against the base of your spine.

After the operation, his mind was clear, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like different person. He could make new beginning and live new life. He walked past men's clothing store and thought, That's what need, new suit. He entered the shop and told the salesman, I'd like new suit. The salesman eyed him briefly and said, Let's see, size 44 long? Joe laughed, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. replied the salesman. Joe tried on the suit, and it fit him perfectly. As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, How about new shirt? Joe thought for moment and then said, Sure!. The salesman eyed Joe, then said, Let's see, 34 sleeve and 16 and half neck.. Joe was surprised, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. came the familiar reply. Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly, as well. The salesman asked, How about new shoes?. Joe was on roll and agreed. The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, Let's see, nine-and-a-half? Joe was astonished, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. said the salesman, again. Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly, again. He walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, How about some new underwear? Joe thought for second and said, Sure, why not. The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, Let's see, size 36. Joe laughed smugly, No, I've worn size 34 since was 18 years old. The shocked salesman shook his head, You can't possibly wear size 34!	It would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of headache.

Because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve.- Mywork was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. Right now, the world leave behind enters revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.- Myconnections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.- Iknow all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you true example of someone who achieved everything that ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation. Thethree people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.- Impossible,yells the 1st person! Such plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?- Who?M-me? only had two part time jobs, nothing else that can remember. During the morning hours worked in small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.- You'rejoking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?- Oh...thatone was bit odd. My village had signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.- Thisis preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?- W-well,don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.	(

Stoner Joke. Three Men Died and Went to Hell Where They Met the Devil. Long one) .  Three men died and went to hell where they met the Devil. The Devil told them that they had sinned in life and therefore had to spend the next 666 years in hell to atone for their sins. However, since the Devil wasn't entirely merciless, he would let them choose for themselves how they were going to spend those 666 years. And so the Devil let the men to three doors. Goingthrough the first door, they entered what looked to be normal bar. Although, if you were there for more than an hour, you would notice that no matter how much you tried to drink another bottle would appear on the shelf. And even better, the bar always had the exact drink you wanted available. An unlimited supply of every alcoholic beverage in existence. It was, in short, drunkard's paradise. Whenthey entered the second door, they were greeted by myriad of women all ready to satisfy every sexual desire they could possible have. There were multiple women of every shape, size and ethnicity imaginable. Looking closer you would notice that there were even celebrity and work crushes from your life in the crowd. Every single one of them ready to please you. It was, in short, pervert's paradise Finally,when they entered the third door, they found themselves in forest made of cannabis. The ground was made of kief, all the bushes wore beatiful buds and even the trees were 20 feet tall cannabis plants. There were every strain it has or ever will be possible to grow. You could even find rocks of hashish laying around the forest floor if you looked closely. It was, in short, stoner's paradise. TheDevil asked the men which room they each wanted. The words had barely left the Devil's mouth before the first man ran directly to the room with myriad of women. The second man then went to the room with the bar, thinking that if he was going to spend 666 years in hell, he might as well be drunk for most of it. Lastly, the third man, thinking he had won the lottery, gladly went towards the room with the forest of cannabis.666 years later, the Devil returned to see if the men had atoned for their sins. Whenhe opened the first door, bottles slowly rolled out and you could immediately smell piss and puke coming from the room. It took the Devil while, but he finally found the man nestled between the bottles, smeared in his own shit and puke, and with arguably the worst hangover in history. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out. Whenhe opened the second door, he was overwhelmed with the sound of hundreds of crying children and angry women. Not ten seconds after the door opened, the man came running, pleading for the Devil to please let him out. There were kids of every age running around screaming and all the women were angry at each other, while everyone, children and mothers alike, were angry at the man. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out. Whenthe Devil opened the third door, he immediately saw the man sitting cross legged in giant pool of his own tears. The Devil had not expected this. Confused, he went to ask the man what was wrong.	The man, tears still running down his face, looked up at the Devil and said: Idon't have lighter

An manager was knocked down (tragically) by bus and was killed. Her soul arrived at the Pearly Gates, where St. Peterwelcomed her. .  Before you get settled in he said, We have little problem…you see, we've never had manager make it this far before and we're not really sure what to do with you. Oh,see, said the woman, can't you just let me in? Well,I'd like to, said St Peter, But have higher orders. We're instructed to let you have day in hell and day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you'd like to go for all eternity. Actually,think I'd prefer heaven, said the woman. Sorry, we have rules… at which St. Peter put the manager into the downward bound elevator. Asthe doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto beautiful golf course. In the distance was country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times. Theyplayed perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had wonderful night telling jokes and dancing. Beforeshe knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. Now it's time to spend day in heaven, he said. Soshe spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day's end St. Peter returned. So, he said, You've spent day in hell and you've spent day in heaven. You must choose between the two. Thewoman thought for second and replied: Well, heaven is certainly lovely, but actually had better time in hell. choose Hell. Accordingly,St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her. Idon't understand, stuttered the manager, The other day was here, and there was golf course, and country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had wonderful happy time. Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.	TheDevil simply looked at her and smiled, Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you're staff.

The salesman eyed Joe, then said, Let's see, 34 sleeve and 16 and half neck.. Joe was surprised, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. came the familiar reply. Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly, as well. The salesman asked, How about new shoes?. Joe was on roll and agreed. The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, Let's see, nine-and-a-half? Joe was astonished, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. said the salesman, again. Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly, again. He walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, How about some new underwear? Joe thought for second and said, Sure, why not. The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, Let's see, size 36. Joe laughed smugly, No, I've worn size 34 since was 18 years old. The shocked salesman shook his head, You can't possibly wear size 34!	It would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of headache.

Sales pitch .

Wishingto save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins. Attilawas pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that city he had raided just happened to have Christian convent with convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet. Butthe snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed. Standingbefore Attila, the old man calmly said, Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me. Curious,Attila did as he asked. Thenthe old man took some bread and gave it to Attila. Nowhold these in both hands, he instructed. Attiladid so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.	Toan amazed Attila, the old man simply said, Thyanaconda don't want nun unless you've got buns, Hun.

Once upon time there lived ravishing Queen with huge tits.. .  Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason.

TheKing, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts.

Man wakes up in slum with no memory of how he got there. .  He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is. You'rein the afterlife! he tells the man, But you must have been real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here. Allof sudden, siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. guard in heavy body armor blows whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines. Thebeggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there. Sothe man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's bit below average for real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into familiar former beggar as he crosses the street. Whatare the odds? they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line. The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch. Whilehe's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it! Sadly,this proved not to be true. After only few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in glittering, clean city full of glass and steel. Andwouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. Come, the beggar told him, I'll take you to the evening meal. So the man followed and they entered glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line, and then he added, and apparently here, they change the meals times year! Theman rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for million dollars to pass. Well the man was bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. What is it, he thought, that could possibly be more wonderful than what have here? That question haunted him for weeks until he came to conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring. Fiftyyears later, he returned to the guards with million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same. Thebeggar laughed jovially. got here only three years ago myself, but somehow knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in! Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own. Smilingat the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. That's the line for the dragon meat, he said before turning to the next line, and that's the line for angeldust stew, then he paused, confused. Whatis it? the man asked his old friend.	Thebeggar replied, There appears to be no punchline.

So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for living. .  He loved his job. Driving train had been his dream ever since he was child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was little too reckless and caused crash. He made it out, but single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said failed execution was sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. Theman looked at the executioner and said, Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just bad conductor.

The angle replies to them, No worries, you can have as much food as you like without worrying about it. The guys are elated by that news, when the angel decides to show them another place. Next,the angel decides to show them place where they can spend time having fun. He shows them to massive building with games everywhere you look. There are at least 50 pool tables, 30 bowling alley lanes, people are playing poker, there are arcade games everywhere, and tons of people enjoying themselves. He tells them, Thisis where you may spend much of your time, if you choose. Many people enjoy it here and you might find some new friends. The guys really like this room, but Earl notices that Chester is looking sad again. Earls asks him, What'swrong?. Chester responds with, Mywife left me because of my gambling problems, don't want to disappoint anyone else because of it. I'm afraid wont be able to enjoy this area. The angel then slightly irritated lets him know, Don'tyou see? There are no problems here. You don't have to worry about gambling issues, because money isn't an issue here. Chester is especially happy to hear that news, and the angel decides to show them where they are going to live. Theangel finally takes them to the third place, and it is huge mansion. The guys are led inside, when the angel says, This is where you three can live, if you choose to. Otherwise we have some other mansions, if you want to live alone. The guys are very intrigued by the house, they notice big window on wall with an amazing view. They could see for at least miles clearly. They all can't help but gasp when looking through the window. Earl can't help but be concerned about this place. He decides to ask, So, uh... What's the rent here?. The angel looks back at them with an irritated glare are replies Nothing? It's free. Earl is sure to thank the angel and says, Wow!That's so kind of you guys!. Bert notices that Chester is looking little sad. Bert says, What'swrong Chester? Isn't it amazing here?. Chester looks up, looks Bert in the eye and says little mad, If it weren't for your goddamn diet. Bert.	We could've been here 20 years ago!.

Once upon time in an old magical kingdom, there lived an young monk called Sam... .  His order was renowned for their beautiful choralsinging. They trained, hours every day, refiningtheir voices and their art. Their song floateddown the mountainside, enriching the lives andsouls of the townspeople below Samwas particularly gifted, and on his 19thbirthday, in mid-song, he hit upon beautifullyintricate note of pure magic. Everyone withinmiles just froze in mid action, stirred to the verycore of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. Andall the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam,and Sam was the first person in historyto hit one of the rumored Magical Notes thatmusicians had theorized must exist... yet no onebefore Sam had ever reached one. Andon Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. Thistime, the town below was so impactedthat no one moved, spoke, or even blink forseveral minutes after. As the golden sound finallytapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam hadfound the Second Note... Andthe next year on Sam's birthday, the townhad realized there was pattern involved. Thistime, all of the townspeople were present in themonastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hitthe glorious Third Note. People cried out in purepurejoy as the sound grew to glorious crescendo. Wordscannot do justice to the experience. Thetown flourished, as Sam's notes made the peoplepure all the way to the core of their beings. Andon it went for the next few years, the Magical Notesgrowing sweeter and sweeter... until, thatis, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From thestart, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and thisnew sound was not beautiful... it was jarring anddiscordant. Sam started to get very warm, andwas visibly sweating onstage. He doubled hisresolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet partof the Magical Note that he knew must be there. Suddenly,to the horror of all, Sam spontaneouslycombusted! The two closest monks on stagewere burned by the flames coming off of hisbody, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soonthe entire monastery was aflame. By miracle,everyone made it out, except for poor Sam Thetownsfolk were left staring at the burningmonastery in sad, stunned disbelief. Themayor approached the lead monk of theorder. What happened? he asked, exasperated Theold monk shook his head sadly. Isn't itobvious? he said. Sam sung Note 7.	PSNot mine but the best I've ever heard

Stoner Joke. Three Men Died and Went to Hell Where They Met the Devil. Long one) .  Three men died and went to hell where they met the Devil. The Devil told them that they had sinned in life and therefore had to spend the next 666 years in hell to atone for their sins. However, since the Devil wasn't entirely merciless, he would let them choose for themselves how they were going to spend those 666 years. And so the Devil let the men to three doors. Goingthrough the first door, they entered what looked to be normal bar. Although, if you were there for more than an hour, you would notice that no matter how much you tried to drink another bottle would appear on the shelf. And even better, the bar always had the exact drink you wanted available. An unlimited supply of every alcoholic beverage in existence. It was, in short, drunkard's paradise. Whenthey entered the second door, they were greeted by myriad of women all ready to satisfy every sexual desire they could possible have. There were multiple women of every shape, size and ethnicity imaginable. Looking closer you would notice that there were even celebrity and work crushes from your life in the crowd. Every single one of them ready to please you. It was, in short, pervert's paradise Finally,when they entered the third door, they found themselves in forest made of cannabis. The ground was made of kief, all the bushes wore beatiful buds and even the trees were 20 feet tall cannabis plants. There were every strain it has or ever will be possible to grow. You could even find rocks of hashish laying around the forest floor if you looked closely. It was, in short, stoner's paradise. TheDevil asked the men which room they each wanted. The words had barely left the Devil's mouth before the first man ran directly to the room with myriad of women. The second man then went to the room with the bar, thinking that if he was going to spend 666 years in hell, he might as well be drunk for most of it. Lastly, the third man, thinking he had won the lottery, gladly went towards the room with the forest of cannabis.666 years later, the Devil returned to see if the men had atoned for their sins. Whenhe opened the first door, bottles slowly rolled out and you could immediately smell piss and puke coming from the room. It took the Devil while, but he finally found the man nestled between the bottles, smeared in his own shit and puke, and with arguably the worst hangover in history. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out. Whenhe opened the second door, he was overwhelmed with the sound of hundreds of crying children and angry women. Not ten seconds after the door opened, the man came running, pleading for the Devil to please let him out. There were kids of every age running around screaming and all the women were angry at each other, while everyone, children and mothers alike, were angry at the man. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out. Whenthe Devil opened the third door, he immediately saw the man sitting cross legged in giant pool of his own tears. The Devil had not expected this. Confused, he went to ask the man what was wrong.	The man, tears still running down his face, looked up at the Devil and said: Idon't have lighter

perfectly triangular lake has kingdoms on its sides .  perfectly triangular lake has kingdoms on its sides. The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army. Thekingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets rope and swings it over the branch of tall tree, making noose, and hangs pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing the squire from the third kingdom.	And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for living. .  He loved his job. Driving train had been his dream ever since he was child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was little too reckless and caused crash. He made it out, but single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said failed execution was sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. Theman looked at the executioner and said, Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just bad conductor.

Donald Trump was visiting primary school and he visited one of the classes. They were in the middle of discussion related to words and their meanings. .  The teacher asked the President if he would like to lead the discussion on the word tragedy. So the illustrious leader asked the class for an example of tragedy. One little boy stood up and offered: If my best friend, who lives on farm, is playing in the field and tractor runs over him and kills him, that would be tragedy. No, said Trump, that would be an accident little girl raised her hand: If school bus carrying 50 children drove over cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be tragedy. I'm afraid not, explained the president. That's what we would call great loss. The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Trump searched the room. Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of tragedy? Finally at the back of the room small boy raised his hand... In quiet voice he said: If Force One' was carrying you and was struck by friendly fire missile and blown to smithereens, that would be tragedy. Fantastic! exclaimed Trump. That's right. And can you tell me why that would be tragedy?	Well, said the boy, It has to be tragedy, because it certainly wouldn't be great loss, and it probably wouldn't be fucking accident either.
perfectly triangular lake has kingdoms on its sides .  perfectly triangular lake has kingdoms on its sides. The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army. Thekingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets rope and swings it over the branch of tall tree, making noose, and hangs pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing the squire from the third kingdom.	And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. Theman looked at the executioner and said, Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just bad conductor.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened. Theman was perfectly fine. Well,at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said failed execution was sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.

I'm not giving you thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. Theman looked at the executioner and said Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just bad conductor.

new twist on an old joke. .  Scientists recently did study on the effects the right side and left side of brain had on counting. Theyfirst took out the left half of man's brain and asked him to count to 10. He says, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. Theyput the left half back in and removed the right half, asking him to count to 10 again. He says 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. Finallythey decided to just go for it and removed the whole brain. They again asked him to count to 10 one more time. Hesays, Look. I'm great at counting to 10, ok? love numbers and have the best numbers. No one has better numbers than do. My 4th grade math teacher and let me tell you, she was the best and smartest math teacher in the country at the time my 4th grade math teacher said to me that am the best counter she's ever seen. The best. So if you want me to count to 10, let me tell you can count to 10 alright. That's no problem. will do it. will.	And will do it better than any has ever done it before, ok?

priest told me this joke as kid. .  There were men, they were best friends, and they were quite unhealthy. Their names were, Bert, Chester, and Earl. Theywere actually really unhealthy and Bert decided that he needed to take charge of him and his friends' health. He decided that they were going to be on diet together to help them live for as long as possible. He broke the news to his friends, and they weren't too happy about it, but they decided to go along with it anyways, because they knew how out-of-shape they all were. It was tough for them all to stick to the plan at times, however they got through it together. They each lost between 120-140 pounds over the course of 20 years and were in amazing shape for their age. Oneday the of them were given great news. Bertgot call, he answered it, then turned around to everyone and said: Guys! My daughter just had child! I'm going to be grandpa!. Everybody was celebrating for Bert when Earl got call from his son. He answered it, and turned around to everybody and said: Guys!My son is going to get married today! I'm so excited!. Everybody was now celebrating for Bert and Earl, when Chester got call. He answered it, turned around and said to everybody: Guys! My family is having reunion today! I'm going to see so many people that haven't seen in years!. Theyfound out that the wedding, hospital, and park where the reunion was were all in the same town, and decided to carpool together to get there. It had snowed little the day before and the roads were little icy. As they were getting onto the highway, their car slipped and ran into semi-truck. It killed all three of them. Thethree of them wake up together in heaven. They notice an angel standing over them and one of them asks Where are we?. The angels says: Congratulations, you made it to heaven. The angel decides to show them around the place and starts at banquet. Here is banquet for you three to enjoy, you've earned it. Chester looks little sad, and Earl notices and asks him, What's wrong?. Chester finally speaks up, Okay, this is so nice of you to put together, but we're on diet. wouldn't want to overdo my calorie intake for the day. The angle replies to them, No worries, you can have as much food as you like without worrying about it. The guys are elated by that news, when the angel decides to show them another place. Next,the angel decides to show them place where they can spend time having fun. He shows them to massive building with games everywhere you look. There are at least 50 pool tables, 30 bowling alley lanes, people are playing poker, there are arcade games everywhere, and tons of people enjoying themselves. He tells them, Thisis where you may spend much of your time, if you choose. Many people enjoy it here and you might find some new friends. The guys really like this room, but Earl notices that Chester is looking sad again. Earls asks him, What'swrong?. Chester responds with, Mywife left me because of my gambling problems, don't want to disappoint anyone else because of it. I'm afraid wont be able to enjoy this area. The angel then slightly irritated lets him know, Don'tyou see? There are no problems here. You don't have to worry about gambling issues, because money isn't an issue here. Chester is especially happy to hear that news, and the angel decides to show them where they are going to live. Theangel finally takes them to the third place, and it is huge mansion. The guys are led inside, when the angel says, This is where you three can live, if you choose to. Otherwise we have some other mansions, if you want to live alone. The guys are very intrigued by the house, they notice big window on wall with an amazing view. They could see for at least miles clearly. They all can't help but gasp when looking through the window. Earl can't help but be concerned about this place. He decides to ask, So, uh... What's the rent here?. The angel looks back at them with an irritated glare are replies Nothing? It's free. Earl is sure to thank the angel and says, Wow!That's so kind of you guys!. Bert notices that Chester is looking little sad. Bert says, What'swrong Chester? Isn't it amazing here?. Chester looks up, looks Bert in the eye and says little mad, If it weren't for your goddamn diet. Bert.	We could've been here 20 years ago!.

married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. .  Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented new machine that would transfer portion of the mother's labor pain to the father. He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it. Thedoctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. Thedoctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer the pain to him. The wife delivered healthy baby with virtually no pain. She and her husband were ecstatic.	Whenthey got home, the mailman was dead on the porch.

Three years ago mistakenly bought my son giant conch shell… .  have son who's on the spectrum. It's quite common for people like him to latch onto one specific topic and become an absolute encyclopedia about it. Some people choose trains, some cartoon. For my son, this was mollusks. Interesting topic know, but it seemed to be pretty good deal for us because it meant he'd get really excited about going outside to the beach which we figured was healthier than staying inside all the time. He'd always have shell with him, or in his pocket. Usually he doesn't want to talk much, but if you opened the conversation to it, he'd sit there rattling off facts about mollusks for hours. This was shaping up to be long term passion, so for his 15th birthday went out and bought him giant conch shell. He absolutely loved it. The texture, holding it to his ear etc. It was too big to carry around with him all the time, but he kept it by his bed. Fast forward three years, this is where things get weird. About month ago was cleaning his room and picked up the conch to dust it off, something I've never actually done before. was immediately hit by terrible smell don't want to get too into the gross details but I'm dude, once 18 year old dude, so know what happens when you use something to masturbate and don't clean it. I'm sure we all know what that smells like even after week. It was pretty clear he had been using this shell as kind of Strombidae fleshlight for long, long time without cleaning it. I'm not going to share too much about what happened when this all came to light, but we tried taking it away and my god you'd think we just took his whole world. We decided to give the shell back, but worried this reflected deeper issue my partner and decided to get some professional help. So it's been about month of him seeing behavioural therapist, and she recently asked me about his progress at home. told her it's been incredibly promising so far.	He's really starting to come out of his shell.

Once upon time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived young monk named Sam. .  His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below. Samwas particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one. Andon Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings. Andon it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there. Suddenly,to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam. Thetownsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief. Themayor approached the lead monk of the order. What happened? he asked, exasperated. Theold monk shook his head sadly. Isn't it obvious? he said. Sam sung Note 7.- Wow, came back and this really blew up!

Tell the Punchline first. . 	 How do you ruin joke?
years ago today, shared the worst joke ever created. Here it is again for those that missed it. .  There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted. About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off. The dentist wakes to knock on the door. Suspecting solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; full skeleton underneath tattered cloak. The grim reaper swears. Oh no! This always happens with identical twins. What do you mean? asks the dentist. Well... if you must know, your brother was in critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now. The dentist is noticeably upset. He says Wait! Isn't there some way can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, made the mistake. Certainly there must be way can bargain for his life. The grim reaper asks What do you have in mind? The dentist thinks. How about challenge? If beat you, you let my brother go free. The grim reaper laughs. will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose? The dentist smiles. propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. minutes of brushing each, then we decide. Very well says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom. Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance. The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like madman. When his minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles. It's unbelievable. The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth. The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. You win, human. This time. Your brother will live. He disappears in puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, went out to the market and got hit by car. They say almost died. The dentist smiles on the phone and says. That's interesting, bro.	Today you might say that also had brush with death.

If can guess your last words in three tries, you have to let me cut ahead of you. Theold man, having nothing better to do, agrees. Immediately, the gambler begins reading him like the pro player he is. He notices the elderly Asian man's shirt is open, exposing pair of defibrillator marks.

There was this tramp. .  One cold winter's morning he was walking along country road, when he heard cry for help from nearby lake. Withoutmoment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for car to flag down. Coincidentallythe father drives up. How can ever thank you sir? he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. Just name your price I'm wealthy man. Ah,well... stammers the tramp, ... uh, I'm little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out. Ohdear, says the father, don't carry much cash with me, only have ten pounds but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe. No!No! says the tramp, Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life that'll be plenty. Tenpounds, thinks the tramp, I'm rich! I'm rich! and off he goes to the town to buy himself holiday. Hefinds travel agent, walks in much to the disgust of the staff and goes up to the desk. I'll have one holiday please! Ahem,which holiday would sir like? asked the girl at the desk, forcing smile. Oh,any holiday don't mind, anything up to ten pounds, replies the tramp. TENYou'll get holiday for ten pounds, says the girl incredulously. Shegoes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There to her amazement she finds an old file. Wellyou'll never believe it, she says to the tramp, back in the shop. I've got you holiday its super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise and it costs ten pounds. Yippee!exclaims the tramp, I'll take it! Afew days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen. Getoff my ship ye dirty bum! shouts voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside. ButI've got my ticket!, responds the tramp, super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and want on! Wellokay, says the captain, but you can't come on just now, don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then. Sothe tramp finds himself quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep. Psst,says voice, waking him with start. It was the captain. Hurryup, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin. Thetramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship and what ship! Firstthey went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets pile. genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere. Thenthe second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens watertight door into tiny 7' 4' cabin, with hammock, bedside table, and an alarm clock. Sheerluxury! exclaimed the tramp, room of my very own. I'mglad you like it, replies the captain, but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise. Wellthe cruise began, and the tramp had whale of time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen... Thenone morning, week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below. Heclimbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what dive...! Perfectlypoised in the air, he hit the water without so much as ripple. Nowunknown to him, the captain who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp was standing watching this. Thatwas amazing! exclaimed the captain, Where did you learn to dive like that? Um,well I've never actually dived before, replied the tramp. Wellthat's incredible! says the captain, I've never seen... He broke off. Hey, I've got an idea, he started again. How would you like to train bit, and we'll put on show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class! It'sdeal! says our man. For the next weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it. Thenone morning the captain comes to talk. Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next days. We're going to erect high diving board for you. Okay,agreed the tramp. Twodays passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose slender column of metal. Well,tramp, said the captain, shaking his hand, Let's see what you can do. And with that the Captain handed him walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...up and up...below him the ship grew smaller...on and on...past solitary albatross...and still higher...till the ship was but speck on the ocean below...and on still further.../ till the ocean grew dim...and the earth itself...began to shrink...past our moon...and on...and Mars...and on...higher, and higher...through the asteroid belt...and on and on towards the diving board...past the outer planets, until...on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...he reached the board. Heclimbed on top and radioed the captain...and then....' '.. .. .he jumped.....: Slowlyat first,:but speeding up,:::faster, and faster,:speeding past Pluto,:and the other outer planets,.........through the asteroid belt,past Mars,and the moon,faster,and faster,faster ever faster,and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,faster, and faster,past the albatross,double-back somersault,and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet, Downon the ship the crew strained their necks, Iyelled passenger, tramp streaked down towards the pool, did last triple flip, and dove... NOTthe sea bed, sinking 37' shaft in the process. Desperatefor air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface. Upand up, desperate, gasping... Outof the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into throng wild with acclaim. HERO!handing him heated towel the captain spoke, as hush fell over the crowd. Welltramp, have seen anything like that, That was the most piece of diving have ever seen. Thetramp blushed. Thecaptain went on, but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived how did you do it. Andthe tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: Well you see... Forme to tell you, I'll need $49.95 Thecaptain outrageously asked why.

This is the dirty joke my 85yo grandad told to our whole family by memory .  male whale and female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed whaling ship. The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink. They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore. At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him.	Look, she said, went along with the blow job, but absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.

perfectly triangular lake has kingdoms on its sides .  perfectly triangular lake has kingdoms on its sides. The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army. Thekingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets rope and swings it over the branch of tall tree, making noose, and hangs pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing the squire from the third kingdom.	And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

Afew days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. Anyone can make mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day. Thenext day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with new stamp on it. The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter. * Ding-dong,ding-dong. Ding-dong, ding-dong.

Unbutton my blouse.. .  successful rancher died and left everything to his devoted wife. She was very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for ranch hand... Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other drunk. She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. He proved to be hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew lot about ranching.. For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well. Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, You have done really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels. The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night. One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return. Two o'clock and no hired hand. Finally he returned around two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with glass of wine, waiting for him. She quietly called him over to her.. Unbutton my blouse and take it off, she said. Trembling, he did as she directed. Now take off my boots. He did as she asked, ever so slowly.. Now take off my socks. He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots. Now take off my skirt. He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light. Now take off my bra.. Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.	Then she looked at him and said, If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired.

Man wakes up in slum with no memory of how he got there. .  He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is. You'rein the afterlife! he tells the man, But you must have been real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here. Allof sudden, siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. guard in heavy body armor blows whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines. Thebeggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there. Sothe man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's bit below average for real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into familiar former beggar as he crosses the street. Whatare the odds? they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line. The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch. Whilehe's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it! Sadly,this proved not to be true. After only few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in glittering, clean city full of glass and steel. Andwouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. Come, the beggar told him, I'll take you to the evening meal. So the man followed and they entered glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line, and then he added, and apparently here, they change the meals times year! Theman rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for million dollars to pass. Well the man was bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. What is it, he thought, that could possibly be more wonderful than what have here? That question haunted him for weeks until he came to conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring. Fiftyyears later, he returned to the guards with million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same. Thebeggar laughed jovially. got here only three years ago myself, but somehow knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in! Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own. Smilingat the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. That's the line for the dragon meat, he said before turning to the next line, and that's the line for angeldust stew, then he paused, confused. Whatis it? the man asked his old friend.	Thebeggar replied, There appears to be no punchline.

There was huge explosion. massive fireball roared towards him and blew the younger alien off his feet and threw him in burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in cactus patch. Halfan hour passed. When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head.' Whatferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien. damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?'	Theolder alien leaned over, placed friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you never mess with guy who can loop his dick over his shoulder twice and then stick it in his ear.'

We're instructed to let you have day in hell and day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you'd like to go for all eternity. Actually,think I'd prefer heaven, said the woman. Sorry, we have rules… at which St. Peter put the manager into the downward bound elevator. Asthe doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto beautiful golf course. In the distance was country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her.

She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had wonderful night telling jokes and dancing. Beforeshe knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. Now it's time to spend day in heaven, he said.

Oneof the people takes step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled.- BenevolentBuddha, what more could possibly do in my next life? thought lived and acted to the fullest. Because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve.- Mywork was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. Right now, the world leave behind enters revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.- Myconnections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.- Iknow all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you true example of someone who achieved everything that ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation. Thethree people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.- Impossible,yells the 1st person! Such plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?- Who?M-me? only had two part time jobs, nothing else that can remember. During the morning hours worked in small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.- You'rejoking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?- Oh...thatone was bit odd. My village had signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.- Thisis preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?- W-well,don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.	(

Wishingto save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins. Attilawas pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that city he had raided just happened to have Christian convent with convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet. Butthe snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.

TheKing, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as hero. Uponreturning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins.

An ancient mathematical joke .  Once upon time, there were three kingdoms, all bordering on the same lake. For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. Thefirst kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. Thethird kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using looped rope, slung pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor. Thenext day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. Thebattle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.	Andit just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

young Law student, having failed his Law exam, goes up to his crusty old professor, who is renowned for his razor-sharp legal mind. .  Student, Sir, do you really understand everything about this subject? Professor, Actually, probably do. Otherwise wouldn't be professor, would I? Student, So I'd like to ask you question. If you can give me the correct answer, will accept my marks as it is. If you can't give me the correct answer, however, you'll have to give me an A. Professor, Hmmmm, alright. So what's the question? Student, What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? The professor wracks his famous brain, but just can't crack the answer. Finally he gives up and changes the student's failing mark into an as agreed, and the student goes away, very pleased. The professor continues to wrack his brain over the question all afternoon, but still can't get the answer. So finally he calls in group of his brightest students and tells them he has really, really tough question to answer, What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? To the professor's surprise (and embarrassment), all the students immediately raise their hands. All right, says the professor and asks his favorite student to answer. It'squite easy, sir says the student You see, you are 75 years old and married to 30 year old woman, which is legal, but not logical. Your wife has 22 year old lover, which is logical, but not legal.	And your wife's lover failed his exam but you've just given him an A, which is neither legal, nor logical.

Man wakes up in slum with no memory of how he got there. .  He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is. You'rein the afterlife! he tells the man, But you must have been real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here. Allof sudden, siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. guard in heavy body armor blows whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines. Thebeggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there. Sothe man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's bit below average for real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into familiar former beggar as he crosses the street. Whatare the odds? they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line. The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch. Whilehe's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it! Sadly,this proved not to be true. After only few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in glittering, clean city full of glass and steel. Andwouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. Come, the beggar told him, I'll take you to the evening meal. So the man followed and they entered glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line, and then he added, and apparently here, they change the meals times year! Theman rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for million dollars to pass. Well the man was bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. What is it, he thought, that could possibly be more wonderful than what have here? That question haunted him for weeks until he came to conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring. Fiftyyears later, he returned to the guards with million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same. Thebeggar laughed jovially. got here only three years ago myself, but somehow knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in! Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own. Smilingat the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. That's the line for the dragon meat, he said before turning to the next line, and that's the line for angeldust stew, then he paused, confused. Whatis it? the man asked his old friend.	Thebeggar replied, There appears to be no punchline.

Three years ago mistakenly bought my son giant conch shell… .  have son who's on the spectrum. It's quite common for people like him to latch onto one specific topic and become an absolute encyclopedia about it. Some people choose trains, some cartoon. For my son, this was mollusks. Interesting topic know, but it seemed to be pretty good deal for us because it meant he'd get really excited about going outside to the beach which we figured was healthier than staying inside all the time. He'd always have shell with him, or in his pocket. Usually he doesn't want to talk much, but if you opened the conversation to it, he'd sit there rattling off facts about mollusks for hours. This was shaping up to be long term passion, so for his 15th birthday went out and bought him giant conch shell. He absolutely loved it. The texture, holding it to his ear etc. It was too big to carry around with him all the time, but he kept it by his bed. Fast forward three years, this is where things get weird. About month ago was cleaning his room and picked up the conch to dust it off, something I've never actually done before. was immediately hit by terrible smell don't want to get too into the gross details but I'm dude, once 18 year old dude, so know what happens when you use something to masturbate and don't clean it. I'm sure we all know what that smells like even after week. It was pretty clear he had been using this shell as kind of Strombidae fleshlight for long, long time without cleaning it. I'm not going to share too much about what happened when this all came to light, but we tried taking it away and my god you'd think we just took his whole world. We decided to give the shell back, but worried this reflected deeper issue my partner and decided to get some professional help. So it's been about month of him seeing behavioural therapist, and she recently asked me about his progress at home. told her it's been incredibly promising so far.

You have earned the right to reincarnation of your choice. You have much to accomplish yet though. Oneof the people takes step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled.- BenevolentBuddha, what more could possibly do in my next life? thought lived and acted to the fullest. Because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve.- Mywork was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. Right now, the world leave behind enters revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.- Myconnections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.- Iknow all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you true example of someone who achieved everything that ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation. Thethree people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.- Impossible,yells the 1st person! Such plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?- Who?M-me? only had two part time jobs, nothing else that can remember. During the morning hours worked in small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.- You'rejoking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?- Oh...thatone was bit odd. My village had signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.- Thisis preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?- W-well,don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.	(

So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for living. .  He loved his job. Driving train had been his dream ever since he was child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was little too reckless and caused crash. He made it out, but single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said failed execution was sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. Theman looked at the executioner and said, Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just bad conductor.

Five friends were sitting around, debating which Pixar movie is the greatest .  After few hours of debate, no one was willing to concede, and it was decided that vote must be held. Unfortunately, with so few friends present, it was clear that they would need to bring the vote to the greater public. The group decided that each friend would make plea to the subreddit of their choice, and whoever received the most karma for it would win. Adam,already undecided himself, decided to go to /r/ AskReddit.He laid out the agreement, and asked that everyone vote one their favorite movie, and the one with the most votes he would use for the his friends. Unfortunately, as the votes were split in that sub, his highest post amounted to mere 38 points. Paul,big proponent for the Toy Story franchise, posted to /r/nostalgia in the hopes that everyone who grew up with Toy Story would agree. Unfortunately, as there had been two sequels (with third on the way) it wasn't exactly considered nostalgia and he got downvoted into oblivion. Bill,who loved Monsters Inc., made his case using some trickery. Going to /r/news, he found seemingly unrelated post, and made top-level comment describing, in great detail, why Monsters Inc. was the greatest film of all time. The fact that the post was so out of context made everyone flock to it, and drew enough attention to new him over thousand fake internet points. Mike,who loved the Incredibles movies, decided to stay in his wheelhouse. Over the course of several hours, he created each of the family members from the Incredibles in Soulcaliber Finally, he photoshopped the family together, and posted it to /r/gaming. Under normal circumstances this would have skyrocketed to the top, but the format was stale, and thus only received 20k karma. Still, Mike was confident in his victory. Whilethe other four friends came up with plans on how to maximize their karma gains, Chris sat silently. For hours he sat, making no posts, coming up with no original content. Finally, an hour before the deadline, he broke into his neighbor's house, stealing his copy of the Pixar movie Up. He took picture of his theft and posted it directly to /r/ Jokeswith the title the group got together the next day to see who got the most votes, everyone was in awe. Chris's post had over 40,000 points. How did you know that would win? Easy, Chris replied.	Everyone knows stolen content on /r/ Jokesgets all the Up votes.

Joe was moderately successful in his career, but as he got older he was increasingly hampered by incredible headaches. When his personal hygiene and love life started to suffer, he sought medical help. .  After being referred from one specialist to another, he finally came across doctor who solved the problem. The good news is can cure your headaches; the bad news is that it will require castration. You have very rare condition which causes your testicles to press up against the base of your spine. The pressure creates one hell of headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles. Joe was shocked and depressed, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife. After the operation, his mind was clear, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like different person. He could make new beginning and live new life. He walked past men's clothing store and thought, That's what need, new suit. He entered the shop and told the salesman, I'd like new suit. The salesman eyed him briefly and said, Let's see, size 44 long? Joe laughed, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. replied the salesman. Joe tried on the suit, and it fit him perfectly. As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, How about new shirt? Joe thought for moment and then said, Sure!. The salesman eyed Joe, then said, Let's see, 34 sleeve and 16 and half neck.. Joe was surprised, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. came the familiar reply. Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly, as well. The salesman asked, How about new shoes?. Joe was on roll and agreed. The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, Let's see, nine-and-a-half? Joe was astonished, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. said the salesman, again. Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly, again. He walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, How about some new underwear? Joe thought for second and said, Sure, why not. The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, Let's see, size 36. Joe laughed smugly, No, I've worn size 34 since was 18 years old. The shocked salesman shook his head, You can't possibly wear size 34!	It would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of headache.

Three men, Joe, Bro, and Buddy, all lived in small town. .  One day, Joe went hunting alone, and for the next few days no one heard from him. About week afterwards, body was found and brought into the coroner's office. The coroner, after thoroughly examining the body, needed positive identification in order to verify that the body was indeed Joe. So, he brought in Bro and Buddy, and told them to come in separately to identify the body. Bro came in first, and was asked to look for any details about the body that he recognized. After few minutes of examining, Bro said, Mr. Coroner, I'll need you to turn the body over for me to be sure. Confused,the coroner obliged. Bro continued to examine the body, bent down on one knee, reared his head sideways, then stood up and said, No sir, this can't be Joe. Thecoroner was even more confused, but he accepted this statement and sent Bro out. Next, he invited Buddy in to repeat the task. Buddy, after examining the body in similar fashion to Bro, also requested that the body be turned over. Thecoroner, after mumbling bit about his confusion, flipped the body over. Buddy too bent down on one knee and examined the back area of the body, then, just as Bro had previously, said, No sir, Mr. Coroner, this isn't Joe. Thecoroner was astonished, so he asked that Bro come back in so that the two of them were standing there at once. The coroner said, Gentlemen, this man's dental records and features match perfectly with those of your friend Joe's. How on earth are you both positive this isn't him? Broand Buddy looked at each other, then Bro answered, Sir, this can't be Joe because Joe has two assholes. Inshock, the coroner asked, How can he have two assholes? Have you ever seen them? Buddyreplied, No sir, but it was common knowledge. Every time we were out with him, people would say, it's Joe with those two assholes!

If the only way can find out what that sound was is to become monk, how do become monk? Themonks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become monk. Theman sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for.

Themonks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find door made of ruby. Hedemands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behindthat door is another door, this one made of sapphire. Soit went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally,the monks say, This is the last key to the last door. Theman is relieved to no end. Heunlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.	Butcan't tell you what it is because you're not monk

priest told me this joke as kid. .  There were men, they were best friends, and they were quite unhealthy. Their names were, Bert, Chester, and Earl.

It was tough for them all to stick to the plan at times, however they got through it together. They each lost between 120-140 pounds over the course of 20 years and were in amazing shape for their age. Oneday the of them were given great news. Bertgot call, he answered it, then turned around to everyone and said: Guys! My daughter just had child! I'm going to be grandpa!. Everybody was celebrating for Bert when Earl got call from his son. He answered it, and turned around to everybody and said: Guys!My son is going to get married today! I'm so excited!. Everybody was now celebrating for Bert and Earl, when Chester got call.

The angle replies to them, No worries, you can have as much food as you like without worrying about it. The guys are elated by that news, when the angel decides to show them another place. Next,the angel decides to show them place where they can spend time having fun. He shows them to massive building with games everywhere you look. There are at least 50 pool tables, 30 bowling alley lanes, people are playing poker, there are arcade games everywhere, and tons of people enjoying themselves. He tells them, Thisis where you may spend much of your time, if you choose. Many people enjoy it here and you might find some new friends. The guys really like this room, but Earl notices that Chester is looking sad again. Earls asks him, What'swrong?. Chester responds with, Mywife left me because of my gambling problems, don't want to disappoint anyone else because of it. I'm afraid wont be able to enjoy this area. The angel then slightly irritated lets him know, Don'tyou see? There are no problems here. You don't have to worry about gambling issues, because money isn't an issue here. Chester is especially happy to hear that news, and the angel decides to show them where they are going to live. Theangel finally takes them to the third place, and it is huge mansion. The guys are led inside, when the angel says, This is where you three can live, if you choose to. Otherwise we have some other mansions, if you want to live alone. The guys are very intrigued by the house, they notice big window on wall with an amazing view. They could see for at least miles clearly. They all can't help but gasp when looking through the window. Earl can't help but be concerned about this place. He decides to ask, So, uh... What's the rent here?. The angel looks back at them with an irritated glare are replies Nothing? It's free.

Once upon time in an old magical kingdom, there lived an young monk called Sam... .  His order was renowned for their beautiful choralsinging. They trained, hours every day, refiningtheir voices and their art. Their song floateddown the mountainside, enriching the lives andsouls of the townspeople below Samwas particularly gifted, and on his 19thbirthday, in mid-song, he hit upon beautifullyintricate note of pure magic. Everyone withinmiles just froze in mid action, stirred to the verycore of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. Andall the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam,and Sam was the first person in historyto hit one of the rumored Magical Notes thatmusicians had theorized must exist... yet no onebefore Sam had ever reached one. Andon Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. Thistime, the town below was so impactedthat no one moved, spoke, or even blink forseveral minutes after. As the golden sound finallytapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam hadfound the Second Note... Andthe next year on Sam's birthday, the townhad realized there was pattern involved. Thistime, all of the townspeople were present in themonastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hitthe glorious Third Note. People cried out in purepurejoy as the sound grew to glorious crescendo. Wordscannot do justice to the experience. Thetown flourished, as Sam's notes made the peoplepure all the way to the core of their beings. Andon it went for the next few years, the Magical Notesgrowing sweeter and sweeter... until, thatis, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From thestart, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and thisnew sound was not beautiful... it was jarring anddiscordant. Sam started to get very warm, andwas visibly sweating onstage. He doubled hisresolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet partof the Magical Note that he knew must be there. Suddenly,to the horror of all, Sam spontaneouslycombusted! The two closest monks on stagewere burned by the flames coming off of hisbody, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soonthe entire monastery was aflame. By miracle,everyone made it out, except for poor Sam Thetownsfolk were left staring at the burningmonastery in sad, stunned disbelief. Themayor approached the lead monk of theorder. What happened? he asked, exasperated Theold monk shook his head sadly. Isn't itobvious? he said. Sam sung Note 7.	PSNot mine but the best I've ever heard

Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered deal. He'd have religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community... .  If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

However,as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be 'silent' debate. Onthe chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other ThePope raised his hand and showed three fingers. TheRabbi looked back and raised one finger. Next,the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat. ThePope brought out communion wafer and chalice of wine. TheRabbi pulled out an apple. Withthat, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy! Laterthe cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' bested me at every move and could not continue!' Meanwhile,the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. don't have clue!!!' the Rabbi said. he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so told him that we were staying right here. then what?' asked woman. knows...' said the Rabbi.	took out his lunch, so took out mine!'

businessman is getting ready to go on long business trip. He knows his wife is always horny, so he decides to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else. .  So he went to store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation, to the old man. Well,don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except a... said the old man, and then he stopped. Exceptwhat? asked the businessman. Nothing,nothing, said the old man. C'mon,tell me! need something! protested the businessman. Well,sir, don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dildo,' the old man said. Thevoodoo dildo? the businessman asked. Theold man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop! Theold man said, But you haven't seen what it'll do yet. Hepointed to door and said Voodoo dildo, the door. Thevoodoo dildo rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, Voodoo dildo, box! Thevoodoo dildo stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, motionless. Thebusinessman said, I'll take it! Theguy took it home to his wife, told her it was special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, Voodoo dildo, my pussy. Heleft for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone. Afterhe'd been gone few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dildo. She lay down, placed the box between her legs, and said Voodoo dildo, my pussy! The voodoo dildo shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before. Afterthree orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off! So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that voodoo dildo was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing her. Theofficer looked at her for second, and then said, Yeah, right.	Voodoo dildo, my ass!

perfectly triangular lake has kingdoms on its sides .  perfectly triangular lake has kingdoms on its sides. The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army. Thekingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets rope and swings it over the branch of tall tree, making noose, and hangs pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing the squire from the third kingdom.	And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

There was this tramp. .  One cold winter's morning he was walking along country road, when he heard cry for help from nearby lake. Withoutmoment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for car to flag down. Coincidentallythe father drives up. How can ever thank you sir? he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. Just name your price I'm wealthy man. Ah,well... stammers the tramp, ... uh, I'm little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out. Ohdear, says the father, don't carry much cash with me, only have ten pounds but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe. No!No! says the tramp, Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life that'll be plenty. Tenpounds, thinks the tramp, I'm rich! I'm rich! and off he goes to the town to buy himself holiday. Hefinds travel agent, walks in much to the disgust of the staff and goes up to the desk. I'll have one holiday please! Ahem,which holiday would sir like? asked the girl at the desk, forcing smile. Oh,any holiday don't mind, anything up to ten pounds, replies the tramp. TENYou'll get holiday for ten pounds, says the girl incredulously. Shegoes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There to her amazement she finds an old file. Wellyou'll never believe it, she says to the tramp, back in the shop. I've got you holiday its super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise and it costs ten pounds. Yippee!exclaims the tramp, I'll take it! Afew days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen. Getoff my ship ye dirty bum! shouts voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside. ButI've got my ticket!, responds the tramp, super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and want on! Wellokay, says the captain, but you can't come on just now, don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then. Sothe tramp finds himself quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep. Psst,says voice, waking him with start. It was the captain. Hurryup, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin. Thetramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship and what ship! Firstthey went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets pile. genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere. Thenthe second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens watertight door into tiny 7' 4' cabin, with hammock, bedside table, and an alarm clock. Sheerluxury! exclaimed the tramp, room of my very own. I'mglad you like it, replies the captain, but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise. Wellthe cruise began, and the tramp had whale of time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen... Thenone morning, week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below. Heclimbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what dive...! Perfectlypoised in the air, he hit the water without so much as ripple. Nowunknown to him, the captain who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp was standing watching this. Thatwas amazing! exclaimed the captain, Where did you learn to dive like that? Um,well I've never actually dived before, replied the tramp. Wellthat's incredible! says the captain, I've never seen... He broke off. Hey, I've got an idea, he started again. How would you like to train bit, and we'll put on show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class! It'sdeal! says our man. For the next weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it. Thenone morning the captain comes to talk. Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next days. We're going to erect high diving board for you. Okay,agreed the tramp. Twodays passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and hushed awe.

Once upon time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived young monk named Sam. .  His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below. Samwas particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one. Andon Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings. Andon it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there. Suddenly,to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam. Thetownsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief. Themayor approached the lead monk of the order. What happened? he asked, exasperated. Theold monk shook his head sadly. Isn't it obvious? he said. Sam sung Note 7.- Wow, came back and this really blew up! Thanks so much for the kind comments, and upvotes, and gold.	I'm so glad could give so many people chuckle today!

Your .  woman brought very limp duck into veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. Aftermoment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away. Thedistressed woman wailed, Are you sure? Yes,am sure. Your duck is dead, replied the vet.. Howcan you be so sure? she protested.. mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in coma or something. Thevet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned few minutes later with black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. Thevet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. few minutes later he returned with cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. Thevet looked at the woman and said, I'm sorry, but as said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, dead duck. Thevet turned to his computer terminal, hit few keys and produced bill, which he handed to the woman.. Theduck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. $1,500! she cried,$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead! Thevet shrugged, I'm sorry.

Man wakes up in slum with no memory of how he got there. .  He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is. You'rein the afterlife! he tells the man, But you must have been real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here. Allof sudden, siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. guard in heavy body armor blows whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines. Thebeggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there. Sothe man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's bit below average for real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into familiar former beggar as he crosses the street. Whatare the odds? they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line. The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch. Whilehe's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it! Sadly,this proved not to be true. After only few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in glittering, clean city full of glass and steel. Andwouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. Come, the beggar told him, I'll take you to the evening meal. So the man followed and they entered glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line, and then he added, and apparently here, they change the meals times year! Theman rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for million dollars to pass. Well the man was bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. What is it, he thought, that could possibly be more wonderful than what have here? That question haunted him for weeks until he came to conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring. Fiftyyears later, he returned to the guards with million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same. Thebeggar laughed jovially. got here only three years ago myself, but somehow knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in! Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own. Smilingat the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. That's the line for the dragon meat, he said before turning to the next line, and that's the line for angeldust stew, then he paused, confused. Whatis it? the man asked his old friend.	Thebeggar replied, There appears to be no punchline.

As your driver, attended all of them, and even though don't know anything about science, could give the conference in your place. That's great idea! says Einstein. Let's switch places then! So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it. But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond.

The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.

years ago today, shared the worst joke ever created. Here it is again for those that missed it. .  There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted. About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off. The dentist wakes to knock on the door. Suspecting solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; full skeleton underneath tattered cloak. The grim reaper swears. Oh no! This always happens with identical twins. What do you mean? asks the dentist. Well... if you must know, your brother was in critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now. The dentist is noticeably upset. He says Wait! Isn't there some way can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, made the mistake. Certainly there must be way can bargain for his life. The grim reaper asks What do you have in mind? The dentist thinks. How about challenge? If beat you, you let my brother go free. The grim reaper laughs. will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose? The dentist smiles. propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. minutes of brushing each, then we decide. Very well says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom. Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance. The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like madman. When his minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles. It's unbelievable. The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth. The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. You win, human. This time. Your brother will live. He disappears in puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, went out to the market and got hit by car. They say almost died. The dentist smiles on the phone and says. That's interesting, bro.	Today you might say that also had brush with death.

married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. .  Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented new machine that would transfer portion of the mother's labor pain to the father. He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it. Thedoctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. Thedoctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer the pain to him. The wife delivered healthy baby with virtually no pain. She and her husband were ecstatic.	Whenthey got home, the mailman was dead on the porch.

In crowded city at bus stop, beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in tight leather mini skirt, with matching tight leather boots and jacket... .  As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus.

Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't! So, little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt little more and for second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt.

So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for living. .  He loved his job. Driving train had been his dream ever since he was child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was little too reckless and caused crash. He made it out, but single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said failed execution was sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. Theman looked at the executioner and said, Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just bad conductor.

Thethree people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside.

Stoner Joke. Three Men Died and Went to Hell Where They Met the Devil. Long one) .  Three men died and went to hell where they met the Devil. The Devil told them that they had sinned in life and therefore had to spend the next 666 years in hell to atone for their sins. However, since the Devil wasn't entirely merciless, he would let them choose for themselves how they were going to spend those 666 years. And so the Devil let the men to three doors. Goingthrough the first door, they entered what looked to be normal bar. Although, if you were there for more than an hour, you would notice that no matter how much you tried to drink another bottle would appear on the shelf. And even better, the bar always had the exact drink you wanted available. An unlimited supply of every alcoholic beverage in existence. It was, in short, drunkard's paradise. Whenthey entered the second door, they were greeted by myriad of women all ready to satisfy every sexual desire they could possible have. There were multiple women of every shape, size and ethnicity imaginable. Looking closer you would notice that there were even celebrity and work crushes from your life in the crowd. Every single one of them ready to please you. It was, in short, pervert's paradise Finally,when they entered the third door, they found themselves in forest made of cannabis. The ground was made of kief, all the bushes wore beatiful buds and even the trees were 20 feet tall cannabis plants. There were every strain it has or ever will be possible to grow. You could even find rocks of hashish laying around the forest floor if you looked closely. It was, in short, stoner's paradise. TheDevil asked the men which room they each wanted. The words had barely left the Devil's mouth before the first man ran directly to the room with myriad of women. The second man then went to the room with the bar, thinking that if he was going to spend 666 years in hell, he might as well be drunk for most of it. Lastly, the third man, thinking he had won the lottery, gladly went towards the room with the forest of cannabis.666 years later, the Devil returned to see if the men had atoned for their sins. Whenhe opened the first door, bottles slowly rolled out and you could immediately smell piss and puke coming from the room. It took the Devil while, but he finally found the man nestled between the bottles, smeared in his own shit and puke, and with arguably the worst hangover in history. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out. Whenhe opened the second door, he was overwhelmed with the sound of hundreds of crying children and angry women. Not ten seconds after the door opened, the man came running, pleading for the Devil to please let him out. There were kids of every age running around screaming and all the women were angry at each other, while everyone, children and mothers alike, were angry at the man. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out. Whenthe Devil opened the third door, he immediately saw the man sitting cross legged in giant pool of his own tears. The Devil had not expected this. Confused, he went to ask the man what was wrong.	The man, tears still running down his face, looked up at the Devil and said: Idon't have lighter

married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. .

But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. Thedoctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer the pain to him. The wife delivered healthy baby with virtually no pain. She and her husband were ecstatic.	Whenthey got home, the mailman was dead on the porch.

Afteronly few days he is running the riggin like an old hand, he swabs the decks without complaint and spends his free time in amicable companionship playing cards or telling tall tales. Allin all the young man feels as if he has found his calling. Afew weeks go by like this, the young man loving his new life except one part.. There are no women. Aftercouple of months like this, he is starting to feel extremely uncomfortable with the situation and voices his complaints to his shipmates one evening. Whydon't you just use the barrel? Asks one of his mates with surprised look turns out that down in the hold, in dark corner there is barrel, with hole drilled into the side.. Whenever the sailors start to feel their urges rise, they simply go down to the barrel and take care of their business there. Theyoung man decides, with some scepticism, to try the barrel, and finds to his surprise that it is wholly pleasant experience, in no way lesser than any he has had with real women before.

There was this tramp. .  One cold winter's morning he was walking along country road, when he heard cry for help from nearby lake. Withoutmoment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for car to flag down. Coincidentallythe father drives up. How can ever thank you sir? he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. Just name your price I'm wealthy man. Ah,well... stammers the tramp, ... uh, I'm little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out. Ohdear, says the father, don't carry much cash with me, only have ten pounds but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe. No!No! says the tramp, Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life that'll be plenty. Tenpounds, thinks the tramp, I'm rich! I'm rich! and off he goes to the town to buy himself holiday. Hefinds travel agent, walks in much to the disgust of the staff and goes up to the desk. I'll have one holiday please! Ahem,which holiday would sir like? asked the girl at the desk, forcing smile. Oh,any holiday don't mind, anything up to ten pounds, replies the tramp. TENYou'll get holiday for ten pounds, says the girl incredulously. Shegoes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There to her amazement she finds an old file. Wellyou'll never believe it, she says to the tramp, back in the shop. I've got you holiday its super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise and it costs ten pounds. Yippee!exclaims the tramp, I'll take it! Afew days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen. Getoff my ship ye dirty bum! shouts voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside. ButI've got my ticket!, responds the tramp, super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and want on! Wellokay, says the captain, but you can't come on just now, don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then. Sothe tramp finds himself quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep. Psst,says voice, waking him with start. It was the captain. Hurryup, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin. Thetramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship and what ship! Firstthey went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets pile. genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere. Thenthe second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens watertight door into tiny 7' 4' cabin, with hammock, bedside table, and an alarm clock. Sheerluxury! exclaimed the tramp, room of my very own. I'mglad you like it, replies the captain, but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise. Wellthe cruise began, and the tramp had whale of time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen... Thenone morning, week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below. Heclimbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what dive...! Perfectlypoised in the air, he hit the water without so much as ripple. Nowunknown to him, the captain who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp was standing watching this. Thatwas amazing! exclaimed the captain, Where did you learn to dive like that? Um,well I've never actually dived before, replied the tramp. Wellthat's incredible! says the captain, I've never seen... He broke off. Hey, I've got an idea, he started again. How would you like to train bit, and we'll put on show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class! It'sdeal! says our man. For the next weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it. Thenone morning the captain comes to talk. Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next days. We're going to erect high diving board for you. Okay,agreed the tramp. Twodays passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose slender column of metal. Well,tramp, said the captain, shaking his hand, Let's see what you can do. And with that the Captain handed him walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...up and up...below him the ship grew smaller...on and on...past solitary albatross...and still higher...till the ship was but speck on the ocean below...and on still further.../ till the ocean grew dim...and the earth itself...began to shrink...past our moon...and on...and Mars...and on...higher, and higher...through the asteroid belt...and on and on towards the diving board...past the outer planets, until...on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...he reached the board. Heclimbed on top and radioed the captain...and then....' '.. .. .he jumped.....: Slowlyat first,:but speeding up,:::faster, and faster,:speeding past Pluto,:and the other outer planets,.........through the asteroid belt,past Mars,and the moon,faster,and faster,faster ever faster,and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,faster, and faster,past the albatross,double-back somersault,and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet, Downon the ship the crew strained their necks, Iyelled passenger, tramp streaked down towards the pool, did last triple flip, and dove... NOTthe sea bed, sinking 37' shaft in the process. Desperatefor air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface. Upand up, desperate, gasping... Outof the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into throng wild with acclaim. HERO!handing him heated towel the captain spoke, as hush fell over the crowd. Welltramp, have seen anything like that, That was the most piece of diving have ever seen. Thetramp blushed.

politician dies. Instead of going straight to heaven or hell, spirit appears to him. .  The spirit tells him that, rather than being judged for his sins, he gets to choose whether he goes to heaven or hell. The politician replies that of course he wants to go to heaven. The spirit tells him that before he chooses, he has to visit both places so each one will get fair chance. Firstthey visit heaven. It looks pretty nice. Big fluffy clouds, angels singing and playing harps, everyone seeming to enjoy themselves. The politician is pleased, if bit underwhelmed. Hell,on the other hand, is magnificent. It's the most beautiful place the politician has ever seen, and everyone there is having the time of their lives. It has buffet table filled with delicious-smelling food, beautiful garden, pool with water slide, dance floor, massage parlor, and innumerable other attractions. It makes heaven look dull and boring and comparison. Ican't believe I'm saying this, says the politician, but think I'd rather go to hell! Very well, says the spirit. Turn around. Whenthe politician turns around, though, hell appears to be completely different than it had been less than minute ago. All of the attractions are gone, everything is on fire, and the people are screaming in agony. Idon't understand! cries the politician. This isn't what you showed me before! Well,that was the campaign, replies the spirit.	Now you've voted.

How can ever thank you sir? he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. Just name your price I'm wealthy man. Ah,well... stammers the tramp, ... uh, I'm little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out. Ohdear, says the father, don't carry much cash with me, only have ten pounds but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe. No!No! says the tramp, Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life that'll be plenty. Tenpounds, thinks the tramp, I'm rich! I'm rich! and off he goes to the town to buy himself holiday. Hefinds travel agent, walks in much to the disgust of the staff and goes up to the desk. I'll have one holiday please! Ahem,which holiday would sir like? asked the girl at the desk, forcing smile. Oh,any holiday don't mind, anything up to ten pounds, replies the tramp. TENYou'll get holiday for ten pounds, says the girl incredulously. Shegoes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There to her amazement she finds an old file. Wellyou'll never believe it, she says to the tramp, back in the shop. I've got you holiday its super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise and it costs ten pounds. Yippee!exclaims the tramp, I'll take it! Afew days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen. Getoff my ship ye dirty bum! shouts voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside. ButI've got my ticket!, responds the tramp, super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and want on! Wellokay, says the captain, but you can't come on just now, don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then. Sothe tramp finds himself quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep. Psst,says voice, waking him with start. It was the captain. Hurryup, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin. Thetramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship and what ship! Firstthey went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets pile. genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere. Thenthe second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens watertight door into tiny 7' 4' cabin, with hammock, bedside table, and an alarm clock. Sheerluxury! exclaimed the tramp, room of my very own. I'mglad you like it, replies the captain, but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise. Wellthe cruise began, and the tramp had whale of time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen... Thenone morning, week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below. Heclimbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what dive...! Perfectlypoised in the air, he hit the water without so much as ripple. Nowunknown to him, the captain who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp was standing watching this. Thatwas amazing! exclaimed the captain, Where did you learn to dive like that? Um,well I've never actually dived before, replied the tramp. Wellthat's incredible! says the captain, I've never seen... He broke off. Hey, I've got an idea, he started again. How would you like to train bit, and we'll put on show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class! It'sdeal! says our man. For the next weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it. Thenone morning the captain comes to talk. Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next days. We're going to erect high diving board for you. Okay,agreed the tramp. Twodays passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose slender column of metal. Well,tramp, said the captain, shaking his hand, Let's see what you can do. And with that the Captain handed him walkie talkie.

They were both very much in favor of it. Thedoctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. Thedoctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer the pain to him. The wife delivered healthy baby with virtually no pain. She and her husband were ecstatic.	Whenthey got home, the mailman was dead on the porch.

After few minutes of examining, Bro said, Mr. Coroner, I'll need you to turn the body over for me to be sure. Confused,the coroner obliged. Bro continued to examine the body, bent down on one knee, reared his head sideways, then stood up and said, No sir, this can't be Joe. Thecoroner was even more confused, but he accepted this statement and sent Bro out. Next, he invited Buddy in to repeat the task. Buddy, after examining the body in similar fashion to Bro, also requested that the body be turned over. Thecoroner, after mumbling bit about his confusion, flipped the body over. Buddy too bent down on one knee and examined the back area of the body, then, just as Bro had previously, said, No sir, Mr. Coroner, this isn't Joe. Thecoroner was astonished, so he asked that Bro come back in so that the two of them were standing there at once. The coroner said, Gentlemen, this man's dental records and features match perfectly with those of your friend Joe's. How on earth are you both positive this isn't him? Broand Buddy looked at each other, then Bro answered, Sir, this can't be Joe because Joe has two assholes. Inshock, the coroner asked, How can he have two assholes? Have you ever seen them? Buddyreplied, No sir, but it was common knowledge. Every time we were out with him, people would say, it's Joe with those two assholes!

I'm not giving you thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army. Thekingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets rope and swings it over the branch of tall tree, making noose, and hangs pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing the squire from the third kingdom.	And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch. TheKing, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as hero. Uponreturning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with laugh told him to get lost. Thenext day, Horatio slipped massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick. Themoral of the story Pay your bills !	!

It's the most beautiful place the politician has ever seen, and everyone there is having the time of their lives. It has buffet table filled with delicious-smelling food, beautiful garden, pool with water slide, dance floor, massage parlor, and innumerable other attractions. It makes heaven look dull and boring and comparison. Ican't believe I'm saying this, says the politician, but think I'd rather go to hell! Very well, says the spirit. Turn around. Whenthe politician turns around, though, hell appears to be completely different than it had been less than minute ago. All of the attractions are gone, everything is on fire, and the people are screaming in agony. Idon't understand! cries the politician. This isn't what you showed me before! Well,that was the campaign, replies the spirit.	Now you've voted.

Their song floateddown the mountainside, enriching the lives andsouls of the townspeople below Samwas particularly gifted, and on his 19thbirthday, in mid-song, he hit upon beautifullyintricate note of pure magic. Everyone withinmiles just froze in mid action, stirred to the verycore of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. Andall the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam,and Sam was the first person in historyto hit one of the rumored Magical Notes thatmusicians had theorized must exist... yet no onebefore Sam had ever reached one. Andon Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. Thistime, the town below was so impactedthat no one moved, spoke, or even blink forseveral minutes after. As the golden sound finallytapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam hadfound the Second Note... Andthe next year on Sam's birthday, the townhad realized there was pattern involved. Thistime, all of the townspeople were present in themonastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hitthe glorious Third Note. People cried out in purepurejoy as the sound grew to glorious crescendo.

Hiswife went and got the money and then said goodbye. Thefarmer arrived in town late that day and had to get hotel room. The next morning he only had 401 dollars left. He went to the market and was able to buy strong, young bull with the 400 dollars. It had been long time since he had been to town, but as long as the telegraph prices hadn't gone up, he should be able to send full sentence to his wife with his dollar. Whenhe arrived at the post office, he said to the telegraph operator: need to send message to my wife so she can pick up my bull and I. How much is word? Priceswent up few years ago, replied the operator. word is dollar. Ohno, said the farmer can only send one word! He thought for little while and then said, Ok, send my wife the word 'comfortable.' Comfortable?Are you sure? asked the operator. Mywife has 4th grade education, the farmer replied. When she reads she has to sound each word out syllable by syllable.	So when she sees the word comfortable, she'll read it as 'come-for-ta-bull.'

An manager was knocked down (tragically) by bus and was killed. Her soul arrived at the Pearly Gates, where St. Peterwelcomed her. .  Before you get settled in he said, We have little problem…you see, we've never had manager make it this far before and we're not really sure what to do with you. Oh,see, said the woman, can't you just let me in? Well,I'd like to, said St Peter, But have higher orders. We're instructed to let you have day in hell and day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you'd like to go for all eternity. Actually,think I'd prefer heaven, said the woman. Sorry, we have rules… at which St. Peter put the manager into the downward bound elevator. Asthe doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto beautiful golf course. In the distance was country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times. Theyplayed perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had wonderful night telling jokes and dancing. Beforeshe knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. Now it's time to spend day in heaven, he said. Soshe spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day's end St. Peter returned. So, he said, You've spent day in hell and you've spent day in heaven. You must choose between the two. Thewoman thought for second and replied: Well, heaven is certainly lovely, but actually had better time in hell. choose Hell. Accordingly,St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her. Idon't understand, stuttered the manager, The other day was here, and there was golf course, and country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had wonderful happy time. Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.	TheDevil simply looked at her and smiled, Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you're staff.

Once upon time in an old magical kingdom, there lived an young monk called Sam... .  His order was renowned for their beautiful choralsinging. They trained, hours every day, refiningtheir voices and their art. Their song floateddown the mountainside, enriching the lives andsouls of the townspeople below Samwas particularly gifted, and on his 19thbirthday, in mid-song, he hit upon beautifullyintricate note of pure magic. Everyone withinmiles just froze in mid action, stirred to the verycore of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. Andall the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam,and Sam was the first person in historyto hit one of the rumored Magical Notes thatmusicians had theorized must exist... yet no onebefore Sam had ever reached one. Andon Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. Thistime, the town below was so impactedthat no one moved, spoke, or even blink forseveral minutes after. As the golden sound finallytapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam hadfound the Second Note... Andthe next year on Sam's birthday, the townhad realized there was pattern involved. Thistime, all of the townspeople were present in themonastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hitthe glorious Third Note. People cried out in purepurejoy as the sound grew to glorious crescendo. Wordscannot do justice to the experience. Thetown flourished, as Sam's notes made the peoplepure all the way to the core of their beings. Andon it went for the next few years, the Magical Notesgrowing sweeter and sweeter... until, thatis, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From thestart, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and thisnew sound was not beautiful... it was jarring anddiscordant. Sam started to get very warm, andwas visibly sweating onstage. He doubled hisresolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet partof the Magical Note that he knew must be there. Suddenly,to the horror of all, Sam spontaneouslycombusted! The two closest monks on stagewere burned by the flames coming off of hisbody, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soonthe entire monastery was aflame. By miracle,everyone made it out, except for poor Sam Thetownsfolk were left staring at the burningmonastery in sad, stunned disbelief. Themayor approached the lead monk of theorder. What happened? he asked, exasperated Theold monk shook his head sadly. Isn't itobvious? he said. Sam sung Note 7.	PSNot mine but the best I've ever heard

perfectly triangular lake has kingdoms on its sides .  perfectly triangular lake has kingdoms on its sides. The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army. Thekingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets rope and swings it over the branch of tall tree, making noose, and hangs pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing the squire from the third kingdom.	And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

Stoner Joke. Three Men Died and Went to Hell Where They Met the Devil. Long one) .  Three men died and went to hell where they met the Devil. The Devil told them that they had sinned in life and therefore had to spend the next 666 years in hell to atone for their sins. However, since the Devil wasn't entirely merciless, he would let them choose for themselves how they were going to spend those 666 years. And so the Devil let the men to three doors. Goingthrough the first door, they entered what looked to be normal bar. Although, if you were there for more than an hour, you would notice that no matter how much you tried to drink another bottle would appear on the shelf. And even better, the bar always had the exact drink you wanted available. An unlimited supply of every alcoholic beverage in existence. It was, in short, drunkard's paradise. Whenthey entered the second door, they were greeted by myriad of women all ready to satisfy every sexual desire they could possible have. There were multiple women of every shape, size and ethnicity imaginable. Looking closer you would notice that there were even celebrity and work crushes from your life in the crowd. Every single one of them ready to please you. It was, in short, pervert's paradise Finally,when they entered the third door, they found themselves in forest made of cannabis. The ground was made of kief, all the bushes wore beatiful buds and even the trees were 20 feet tall cannabis plants. There were every strain it has or ever will be possible to grow. You could even find rocks of hashish laying around the forest floor if you looked closely. It was, in short, stoner's paradise. TheDevil asked the men which room they each wanted. The words had barely left the Devil's mouth before the first man ran directly to the room with myriad of women. The second man then went to the room with the bar, thinking that if he was going to spend 666 years in hell, he might as well be drunk for most of it. Lastly, the third man, thinking he had won the lottery, gladly went towards the room with the forest of cannabis.666 years later, the Devil returned to see if the men had atoned for their sins. Whenhe opened the first door, bottles slowly rolled out and you could immediately smell piss and puke coming from the room. It took the Devil while, but he finally found the man nestled between the bottles, smeared in his own shit and puke, and with arguably the worst hangover in history. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out. Whenhe opened the second door, he was overwhelmed with the sound of hundreds of crying children and angry women. Not ten seconds after the door opened, the man came running, pleading for the Devil to please let him out. There were kids of every age running around screaming and all the women were angry at each other, while everyone, children and mothers alike, were angry at the man. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out. Whenthe Devil opened the third door, he immediately saw the man sitting cross legged in giant pool of his own tears. The Devil had not expected this. Confused, he went to ask the man what was wrong.	The man, tears still running down his face, looked up at the Devil and said: Idon't have lighter

Three men, Joe, Bro, and Buddy, all lived in small town. .  One day, Joe went hunting alone, and for the next few days no one heard from him. About week afterwards, body was found and brought into the coroner's office. The coroner, after thoroughly examining the body, needed positive identification in order to verify that the body was indeed Joe. So, he brought in Bro and Buddy, and told them to come in separately to identify the body. Bro came in first, and was asked to look for any details about the body that he recognized. After few minutes of examining, Bro said, Mr. Coroner, I'll need you to turn the body over for me to be sure. Confused,the coroner obliged. Bro continued to examine the body, bent down on one knee, reared his head sideways, then stood up and said, No sir, this can't be Joe. Thecoroner was even more confused, but he accepted this statement and sent Bro out. Next, he invited Buddy in to repeat the task. Buddy, after examining the body in similar fashion to Bro, also requested that the body be turned over. Thecoroner, after mumbling bit about his confusion, flipped the body over. Buddy too bent down on one knee and examined the back area of the body, then, just as Bro had previously, said, No sir, Mr. Coroner, this isn't Joe. Thecoroner was astonished, so he asked that Bro come back in so that the two of them were standing there at once. The coroner said, Gentlemen, this man's dental records and features match perfectly with those of your friend Joe's. How on earth are you both positive this isn't him? Broand Buddy looked at each other, then Bro answered, Sir, this can't be Joe because Joe has two assholes. Inshock, the coroner asked, How can he have two assholes? Have you ever seen them? Buddyreplied, No sir, but it was common knowledge. Every time we were out with him, people would say, it's Joe with those two assholes!

Man wakes up in slum with no memory of how he got there. .  He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is. You'rein the afterlife! he tells the man, But you must have been real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here. Allof sudden, siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. guard in heavy body armor blows whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines. Thebeggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there. Sothe man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's bit below average for real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into familiar former beggar as he crosses the street. Whatare the odds? they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line. The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch. Whilehe's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it! Sadly,this proved not to be true. After only few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in glittering, clean city full of glass and steel. Andwouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. Come, the beggar told him, I'll take you to the evening meal. So the man followed and they entered glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line, and then he added, and apparently here, they change the meals times year! Theman rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for million dollars to pass. Well the man was bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. What is it, he thought, that could possibly be more wonderful than what have here? That question haunted him for weeks until he came to conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring. Fiftyyears later, he returned to the guards with million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same. Thebeggar laughed jovially. got here only three years ago myself, but somehow knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in! Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own. Smilingat the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. That's the line for the dragon meat, he said before turning to the next line, and that's the line for angeldust stew, then he paused, confused. Whatis it? the man asked his old friend.	Thebeggar replied, There appears to be no punchline.

Five friends were sitting around, debating which Pixar movie is the greatest .  After few hours of debate, no one was willing to concede, and it was decided that vote must be held. Unfortunately, with so few friends present, it was clear that they would need to bring the vote to the greater public. The group decided that each friend would make plea to the subreddit of their choice, and whoever received the most karma for it would win. Adam,already undecided himself, decided to go to /r/ AskReddit.He laid out the agreement, and asked that everyone vote one their favorite movie, and the one with the most votes he would use for the his friends. Unfortunately, as the votes were split in that sub, his highest post amounted to mere 38 points. Paul,big proponent for the Toy Story franchise, posted to /r/nostalgia in the hopes that everyone who grew up with Toy Story would agree. Unfortunately, as there had been two sequels (with third on the way) it wasn't exactly considered nostalgia and he got downvoted into oblivion. Bill,who loved Monsters Inc., made his case using some trickery. Going to /r/news, he found seemingly unrelated post, and made top-level comment describing, in great detail, why Monsters Inc. was the greatest film of all time. The fact that the post was so out of context made everyone flock to it, and drew enough attention to new him over thousand fake internet points. Mike,who loved the Incredibles movies, decided to stay in his wheelhouse. Over the course of several hours, he created each of the family members from the Incredibles in Soulcaliber Finally, he photoshopped the family together, and posted it to /r/gaming. Under normal circumstances this would have skyrocketed to the top, but the format was stale, and thus only received 20k karma. Still, Mike was confident in his victory. Whilethe other four friends came up with plans on how to maximize their karma gains, Chris sat silently. For hours he sat, making no posts, coming up with no original content. Finally, an hour before the deadline, he broke into his neighbor's house, stealing his copy of the Pixar movie Up. He took picture of his theft and posted it directly to /r/ Jokeswith the title the group got together the next day to see who got the most votes, everyone was in awe. Chris's post had over 40,000 points. How did you know that would win? Easy, Chris replied.	Everyone knows stolen content on /r/ Jokesgets all the Up votes.

There was this tramp. .  One cold winter's morning he was walking along country road, when he heard cry for help from nearby lake. Withoutmoment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for car to flag down. Coincidentallythe father drives up. How can ever thank you sir? he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. Just name your price I'm wealthy man. Ah,well... stammers the tramp, ... uh, I'm little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out. Ohdear, says the father, don't carry much cash with me, only have ten pounds but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe. No!No! says the tramp, Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life that'll be plenty. Tenpounds, thinks the tramp, I'm rich! I'm rich! and off he goes to the town to buy himself holiday. Hefinds travel agent, walks in much to the disgust of the staff and goes up to the desk. I'll have one holiday please! Ahem,which holiday would sir like? asked the girl at the desk, forcing smile. Oh,any holiday don't mind, anything up to ten pounds, replies the tramp. TENYou'll get holiday for ten pounds, says the girl incredulously. Shegoes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There to her amazement she finds an old file. Wellyou'll never believe it, she says to the tramp, back in the shop. I've got you holiday its super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise and it costs ten pounds. Yippee!exclaims the tramp, I'll take it! Afew days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen. Getoff my ship ye dirty bum! shouts voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside. ButI've got my ticket!, responds the tramp, super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and want on! Wellokay, says the captain, but you can't come on just now, don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then. Sothe tramp finds himself quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep. Psst,says voice, waking him with start. It was the captain. Hurryup, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin. Thetramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship and what ship! Firstthey went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets pile. genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere. Thenthe second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens watertight door into tiny 7' 4' cabin, with hammock, bedside table, and an alarm clock. Sheerluxury! exclaimed the tramp, room of my very own. I'mglad you like it, replies the captain, but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise. Wellthe cruise began, and the tramp had whale of time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen... Thenone morning, week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below. Heclimbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what dive...! Perfectlypoised in the air, he hit the water without so much as ripple. Nowunknown to him, the captain who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp was standing watching this. Thatwas amazing! exclaimed the captain, Where did you learn to dive like that? Um,well I've never actually dived before, replied the tramp. Wellthat's incredible! says the captain, I've never seen... He broke off. Hey, I've got an idea, he started again. How would you like to train bit, and we'll put on show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class! It'sdeal! says our man. For the next weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it. Thenone morning the captain comes to talk. Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next days. We're going to erect high diving board for you. Okay,agreed the tramp. Twodays passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose slender column of metal. Well,tramp, said the captain, shaking his hand, Let's see what you can do. And with that the Captain handed him walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...up and up...below him the ship grew smaller...on and on...past solitary albatross...and still higher...till the ship was but speck on the ocean below...and on still further.../ till the ocean grew dim...and the earth itself...began to shrink...past our moon...and on...and Mars...and on...higher, and higher...through the asteroid belt...and on and on towards the diving board...past the outer planets, until...on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...he reached the board. Heclimbed on top and radioed the captain...and then....' '.. .. .he jumped.....: Slowlyat first,:but speeding up,:::faster, and faster,:speeding past Pluto,:and the other outer planets,.........through the asteroid belt,past Mars,and the moon,faster,and faster,faster ever faster,and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,faster, and faster,past the albatross,double-back somersault,and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet, Downon the ship the crew strained their necks, Iyelled passenger, tramp streaked down towards the pool, did last triple flip, and dove... NOTthe sea bed, sinking 37' shaft in the process. Desperatefor air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface. Upand up, desperate, gasping... Outof the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into throng wild with acclaim. HERO!handing him heated towel the captain spoke, as hush fell over the crowd. Welltramp, have seen anything like that, That was the most piece of diving have ever seen. Thetramp blushed. Thecaptain went on, but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived how did you do it. Andthe tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: Well you see... Forme to tell you, I'll need $49.95 Thecaptain outrageously asked why.

An ancient mathematical joke .  Once upon time, there were three kingdoms, all bordering on the same lake. For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. Thefirst kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. Thethird kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using looped rope, slung pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor. Thenext day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. Thebattle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.	Andit just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

Earl can't help but be concerned about this place. He decides to ask, So, uh... What's the rent here?. The angel looks back at them with an irritated glare are replies Nothing? It's free. Earl is sure to thank the angel and says, Wow!That's so kind of you guys!. Bert notices that Chester is looking little sad. Bert says, What'swrong Chester? Isn't it amazing here?.

He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague, Horatiothe Physician, the King's chief doctor. Horatiothought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made batch of itching powder and poured little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch. TheKing, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as hero. Uponreturning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with laugh told him to get lost. Thenext day, Horatio slipped massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear.	The King immediately summoned Nick.

Five friends were sitting around, debating which Pixar movie is the greatest .  After few hours of debate, no one was willing to concede, and it was decided that vote must be held. Unfortunately, with so few friends present, it was clear that they would need to bring the vote to the greater public. The group decided that each friend would make plea to the subreddit of their choice, and whoever received the most karma for it would win. Adam,already undecided himself, decided to go to /r/ AskReddit.He laid out the agreement, and asked that everyone vote one their favorite movie, and the one with the most votes he would use for the his friends. Unfortunately, as the votes were split in that sub, his highest post amounted to mere 38 points. Paul,big proponent for the Toy Story franchise, posted to /r/nostalgia in the hopes that everyone who grew up with Toy Story would agree. Unfortunately, as there had been two sequels (with third on the way) it wasn't exactly considered nostalgia and he got downvoted into oblivion. Bill,who loved Monsters Inc., made his case using some trickery. Going to /r/news, he found seemingly unrelated post, and made top-level comment describing, in great detail, why Monsters Inc. was the greatest film of all time. The fact that the post was so out of context made everyone flock to it, and drew enough attention to new him over thousand fake internet points. Mike,who loved the Incredibles movies, decided to stay in his wheelhouse. Over the course of several hours, he created each of the family members from the Incredibles in Soulcaliber Finally, he photoshopped the family together, and posted it to /r/gaming. Under normal circumstances this would have skyrocketed to the top, but the format was stale, and thus only received 20k karma. Still, Mike was confident in his victory. Whilethe other four friends came up with plans on how to maximize their karma gains, Chris sat silently. For hours he sat, making no posts, coming up with no original content. Finally, an hour before the deadline, he broke into his neighbor's house, stealing his copy of the Pixar movie Up. He took picture of his theft and posted it directly to /r/ Jokeswith the title the group got together the next day to see who got the most votes, everyone was in awe. Chris's post had over 40,000 points. How did you know that would win? Easy, Chris replied.	Everyone knows stolen content on /r/ Jokesgets all the Up votes.

Joe was astonished, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. said the salesman, again. Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly, again. He walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, How about some new underwear? Joe thought for second and said, Sure, why not. The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, Let's see, size 36. Joe laughed smugly, No, I've worn size 34 since was 18 years old. The shocked salesman shook his head, You can't possibly wear size 34!	It would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of headache.

There was this tramp. .  One cold winter's morning he was walking along country road, when he heard cry for help from nearby lake. Withoutmoment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for car to flag down. Coincidentallythe father drives up. How can ever thank you sir? he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. Just name your price I'm wealthy man. Ah,well... stammers the tramp, ... uh, I'm little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out. Ohdear, says the father, don't carry much cash with me, only have ten pounds but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe. No!No! says the tramp, Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life that'll be plenty. Tenpounds, thinks the tramp, I'm rich! I'm rich! and off he goes to the town to buy himself holiday. Hefinds travel agent, walks in much to the disgust of the staff and goes up to the desk. I'll have one holiday please! Ahem,which holiday would sir like? asked the girl at the desk, forcing smile. Oh,any holiday don't mind, anything up to ten pounds, replies the tramp. TENYou'll get holiday for ten pounds, says the girl incredulously. Shegoes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There to her amazement she finds an old file. Wellyou'll never believe it, she says to the tramp, back in the shop. I've got you holiday its super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise and it costs ten pounds. Yippee!exclaims the tramp, I'll take it! Afew days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen. Getoff my ship ye dirty bum! shouts voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside. ButI've got my ticket!, responds the tramp, super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and want on! Wellokay, says the captain, but you can't come on just now, don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then. Sothe tramp finds himself quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep. Psst,says voice, waking him with start. It was the captain. Hurryup, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin. Thetramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship and what ship! Firstthey went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets pile. genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere. Thenthe second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens watertight door into tiny 7' 4' cabin, with hammock, bedside table, and an alarm clock. Sheerluxury! exclaimed the tramp, room of my very own. I'mglad you like it, replies the captain, but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise. Wellthe cruise began, and the tramp had whale of time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen... Thenone morning, week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below. Heclimbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what dive...! Perfectlypoised in the air, he hit the water without so much as ripple. Nowunknown to him, the captain who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp was standing watching this. Thatwas amazing! exclaimed the captain, Where did you learn to dive like that? Um,well I've never actually dived before, replied the tramp. Wellthat's incredible! says the captain, I've never seen... He broke off. Hey, I've got an idea, he started again. How would you like to train bit, and we'll put on show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class! It'sdeal! says our man. For the next weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it. Thenone morning the captain comes to talk. Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next days. We're going to erect high diving board for you. Okay,agreed the tramp. Twodays passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose slender column of metal. Well,tramp, said the captain, shaking his hand, Let's see what you can do. And with that the Captain handed him walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...up and up...below him the ship grew smaller...on and on...past solitary albatross...and still higher...till the ship was but speck on the ocean below...and on still further.../ till the ocean grew dim...and the earth itself...began to shrink...past our moon...and on...and Mars...and on...higher, and higher...through the asteroid belt...and on and on towards the diving board...past the outer planets, until...on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...he reached the board. Heclimbed on top and radioed the captain...and then....' '.. .. .he jumped.....: Slowlyat first,:but speeding up,:::faster, and faster,:speeding past Pluto,:and the other outer planets,.........through the asteroid belt,past Mars,and the moon,faster,and faster,faster ever faster,and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,faster, and faster,past the albatross,double-back somersault,and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet, Downon the ship the crew strained their necks, Iyelled passenger, tramp streaked down towards the pool, did last triple flip, and dove... NOTthe sea bed, sinking 37' shaft in the process. Desperatefor air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface. Upand up, desperate, gasping... Outof the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into throng wild with acclaim. HERO!handing him heated towel the captain spoke, as hush fell over the crowd. Welltramp, have seen anything like that, That was the most piece of diving have ever seen. Thetramp blushed. Thecaptain went on, but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived how did you do it. Andthe tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: Well you see... Forme to tell you, I'll need $49.95 Thecaptain outrageously asked why.

There's little-known legend about Attila the Hun... .  The story goes that Attila used to collect exotic animals that he found during his conquests. He particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was giant snake. He was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign. Buthis snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet. Wishingto save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins. Attilawas pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that city he had raided just happened to have Christian convent with convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet. Butthe snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed. Standingbefore Attila, the old man calmly said, Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me. Curious,Attila did as he asked. Thenthe old man took some bread and gave it to Attila. Nowhold these in both hands, he instructed. Attiladid so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.	Toan amazed Attila, the old man simply said, Thyanaconda don't want nun unless you've got buns, Hun.

Stoner Joke. Three Men Died and Went to Hell Where They Met the Devil. Long one) .  Three men died and went to hell where they met the Devil. The Devil told them that they had sinned in life and therefore had to spend the next 666 years in hell to atone for their sins. However, since the Devil wasn't entirely merciless, he would let them choose for themselves how they were going to spend those 666 years. And so the Devil let the men to three doors. Goingthrough the first door, they entered what looked to be normal bar. Although, if you were there for more than an hour, you would notice that no matter how much you tried to drink another bottle would appear on the shelf. And even better, the bar always had the exact drink you wanted available. An unlimited supply of every alcoholic beverage in existence. It was, in short, drunkard's paradise. Whenthey entered the second door, they were greeted by myriad of women all ready to satisfy every sexual desire they could possible have. There were multiple women of every shape, size and ethnicity imaginable. Looking closer you would notice that there were even celebrity and work crushes from your life in the crowd. Every single one of them ready to please you. It was, in short, pervert's paradise Finally,when they entered the third door, they found themselves in forest made of cannabis. The ground was made of kief, all the bushes wore beatiful buds and even the trees were 20 feet tall cannabis plants. There were every strain it has or ever will be possible to grow. You could even find rocks of hashish laying around the forest floor if you looked closely. It was, in short, stoner's paradise. TheDevil asked the men which room they each wanted. The words had barely left the Devil's mouth before the first man ran directly to the room with myriad of women. The second man then went to the room with the bar, thinking that if he was going to spend 666 years in hell, he might as well be drunk for most of it. Lastly, the third man, thinking he had won the lottery, gladly went towards the room with the forest of cannabis.666 years later, the Devil returned to see if the men had atoned for their sins. Whenhe opened the first door, bottles slowly rolled out and you could immediately smell piss and puke coming from the room. It took the Devil while, but he finally found the man nestled between the bottles, smeared in his own shit and puke, and with arguably the worst hangover in history. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out. Whenhe opened the second door, he was overwhelmed with the sound of hundreds of crying children and angry women. Not ten seconds after the door opened, the man came running, pleading for the Devil to please let him out. There were kids of every age running around screaming and all the women were angry at each other, while everyone, children and mothers alike, were angry at the man. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out. Whenthe Devil opened the third door, he immediately saw the man sitting cross legged in giant pool of his own tears. The Devil had not expected this. Confused, he went to ask the man what was wrong.	The man, tears still running down his face, looked up at the Devil and said: Idon't have lighter

Once upon time there lived beautiful Queen with large breasts .  Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague, Horatiothe Physician, the King's chief doctor. Horatiothought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made batch of itching powder and poured little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch. TheKing, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as hero. Uponreturning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins.

Thenext day, Horatio slipped massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick. Themoral of the story Pay your bills !	!

An manager was knocked down (tragically) by bus and was killed. Her soul arrived at the Pearly Gates, where St. Peterwelcomed her. .  Before you get settled in he said, We have little problem…you see, we've never had manager make it this far before and we're not really sure what to do with you. Oh,see, said the woman, can't you just let me in? Well,I'd like to, said St Peter, But have higher orders. We're instructed to let you have day in hell and day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you'd like to go for all eternity. Actually,think I'd prefer heaven, said the woman. Sorry, we have rules… at which St. Peter put the manager into the downward bound elevator. Asthe doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto beautiful golf course. In the distance was country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times. Theyplayed perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had wonderful night telling jokes and dancing. Beforeshe knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. Now it's time to spend day in heaven, he said. Soshe spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day's end St. Peter returned. So, he said, You've spent day in hell and you've spent day in heaven. You must choose between the two. Thewoman thought for second and replied: Well, heaven is certainly lovely, but actually had better time in hell. choose Hell. Accordingly,St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her. Idon't understand, stuttered the manager, The other day was here, and there was golf course, and country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had wonderful happy time. Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.	TheDevil simply looked at her and smiled, Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you're staff.

Once upon time there lived beautiful Queen with large breasts .  Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague, Horatiothe Physician, the King's chief doctor. Horatiothought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made batch of itching powder and poured little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch. TheKing, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as hero. Uponreturning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with laugh told him to get lost. Thenext day, Horatio slipped massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick. Themoral of the story Pay your bills !	!

perfectly triangular lake has kingdoms on its sides .  perfectly triangular lake has kingdoms on its sides. The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army. Thekingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets rope and swings it over the branch of tall tree, making noose, and hangs pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing the squire from the third kingdom.	And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

Three men, Joe, Bro, and Buddy, all lived in small town. .  One day, Joe went hunting alone, and for the next few days no one heard from him. About week afterwards, body was found and brought into the coroner's office. The coroner, after thoroughly examining the body, needed positive identification in order to verify that the body was indeed Joe. So, he brought in Bro and Buddy, and told them to come in separately to identify the body. Bro came in first, and was asked to look for any details about the body that he recognized. After few minutes of examining, Bro said, Mr. Coroner, I'll need you to turn the body over for me to be sure. Confused,the coroner obliged. Bro continued to examine the body, bent down on one knee, reared his head sideways, then stood up and said, No sir, this can't be Joe. Thecoroner was even more confused, but he accepted this statement and sent Bro out. Next, he invited Buddy in to repeat the task. Buddy, after examining the body in similar fashion to Bro, also requested that the body be turned over. Thecoroner, after mumbling bit about his confusion, flipped the body over. Buddy too bent down on one knee and examined the back area of the body, then, just as Bro had previously, said, No sir, Mr. Coroner, this isn't Joe. Thecoroner was astonished, so he asked that Bro come back in so that the two of them were standing there at once. The coroner said, Gentlemen, this man's dental records and features match perfectly with those of your friend Joe's. How on earth are you both positive this isn't him? Broand Buddy looked at each other, then Bro answered, Sir, this can't be Joe because Joe has two assholes. Inshock, the coroner asked, How can he have two assholes? Have you ever seen them? Buddyreplied, No sir, but it was common knowledge. Every time we were out with him, people would say, it's Joe with those two assholes!

This is the dirty joke my 85yo grandad told to our whole family by memory .  male whale and female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed whaling ship. The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink. They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore. At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him.	Look, she said, went along with the blow job, but absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.
Once upon time there lived beautiful Queen with large breasts .  Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague, Horatiothe Physician, the King's chief doctor. Horatiothought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made batch of itching powder and poured little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch. TheKing, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as hero. Uponreturning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with laugh told him to get lost. Thenext day, Horatio slipped massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick. Themoral of the story Pay your bills !	!

There was this tramp. .  One cold winter's morning he was walking along country road, when he heard cry for help from nearby lake. Withoutmoment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for car to flag down. Coincidentallythe father drives up. How can ever thank you sir? he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. Just name your price I'm wealthy man. Ah,well... stammers the tramp, ... uh, I'm little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out. Ohdear, says the father, don't carry much cash with me, only have ten pounds but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe. No!No! says the tramp, Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life that'll be plenty. Tenpounds, thinks the tramp, I'm rich! I'm rich! and off he goes to the town to buy himself holiday. Hefinds travel agent, walks in much to the disgust of the staff and goes up to the desk. I'll have one holiday please! Ahem,which holiday would sir like? asked the girl at the desk, forcing smile. Oh,any holiday don't mind, anything up to ten pounds, replies the tramp. TENYou'll get holiday for ten pounds, says the girl incredulously. Shegoes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There to her amazement she finds an old file. Wellyou'll never believe it, she says to the tramp, back in the shop. I've got you holiday its super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise and it costs ten pounds. Yippee!exclaims the tramp, I'll take it! Afew days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen. Getoff my ship ye dirty bum! shouts voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside. ButI've got my ticket!, responds the tramp, super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and want on! Wellokay, says the captain, but you can't come on just now, don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then. Sothe tramp finds himself quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep. Psst,says voice, waking him with start. It was the captain. Hurryup, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin. Thetramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship and what ship! Firstthey went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets pile. genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere. Thenthe second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens watertight door into tiny 7' 4' cabin, with hammock, bedside table, and an alarm clock. Sheerluxury! exclaimed the tramp, room of my very own. I'mglad you like it, replies the captain, but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise. Wellthe cruise began, and the tramp had whale of time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen... Thenone morning, week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below. Heclimbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what dive...! Perfectlypoised in the air, he hit the water without so much as ripple. Nowunknown to him, the captain who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp was standing watching this. Thatwas amazing! exclaimed the captain, Where did you learn to dive like that? Um,well I've never actually dived before, replied the tramp. Wellthat's incredible! says the captain, I've never seen... He broke off. Hey, I've got an idea, he started again. How would you like to train bit, and we'll put on show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class! It'sdeal! says our man. For the next weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it. Thenone morning the captain comes to talk. Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next days. We're going to erect high diving board for you. Okay,agreed the tramp. Twodays passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose slender column of metal. Well,tramp, said the captain, shaking his hand, Let's see what you can do. And with that the Captain handed him walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...up and up...below him the ship grew smaller...on and on...past solitary albatross...and still higher...till the ship was but speck on the ocean below...and on still further.../ till the ocean grew dim...and the earth itself...began to shrink...past our moon...and on...and Mars...and on...higher, and higher...through the asteroid belt...and on and on towards the diving board...past the outer planets, until...on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...he reached the board. Heclimbed on top and radioed the captain...and then....' '.. .. .he jumped.....: Slowlyat first,:but speeding up,:::faster, and faster,:speeding past Pluto,:and the other outer planets,.........through the asteroid belt,past Mars,and the moon,faster,and faster,faster ever faster,and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,faster, and faster,past the albatross,double-back somersault,and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet, Downon the ship the crew strained their necks, Iyelled passenger, tramp streaked down towards the pool, did last triple flip, and dove... NOTthe sea bed, sinking 37' shaft in the process. Desperatefor air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface. Upand up, desperate, gasping... Outof the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into throng wild with acclaim. HERO!handing him heated towel the captain spoke, as hush fell over the crowd. Welltramp, have seen anything like that, That was the most piece of diving have ever seen. Thetramp blushed. Thecaptain went on, but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived how did you do it.

An ancient mathematical joke .  Once upon time, there were three kingdoms, all bordering on the same lake. For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. Thefirst kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. Thethird kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using looped rope, slung pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor. Thenext day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. Thebattle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.	Andit just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

If you can give me the correct answer, will accept my marks as it is. If you can't give me the correct answer, however, you'll have to give me an A. Professor, Hmmmm, alright. So what's the question?

In crowded city at bus stop, beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in tight leather mini skirt, with matching tight leather boots and jacket... .  As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus. Slightly embarrassed and with quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't! So, little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt little more and for second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. With coy little smile to the driver, she again unzipped the offending skirt to give little more slack and again was unable to make the step. Aboutthis time, big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, How dare you touch my body!! don't even know who you are!	Atthis, the Texan drawled, Well ma'am normally would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, kinda figured that we was friends.

The angel then slightly irritated lets him know, Don'tyou see? There are no problems here. You don't have to worry about gambling issues, because money isn't an issue here. Chester is especially happy to hear that news, and the angel decides to show them where they are going to live. Theangel finally takes them to the third place, and it is huge mansion. The guys are led inside, when the angel says, This is where you three can live, if you choose to. Otherwise we have some other mansions, if you want to live alone. The guys are very intrigued by the house, they notice big window on wall with an amazing view. They could see for at least miles clearly. They all can't help but gasp when looking through the window. Earl can't help but be concerned about this place. He decides to ask, So, uh... What's the rent here?. The angel looks back at them with an irritated glare are replies Nothing? It's free. Earl is sure to thank the angel and says, Wow!That's so kind of you guys!. Bert notices that Chester is looking little sad. Bert says, What'swrong Chester? Isn't it amazing here?.

politician dies. Instead of going straight to heaven or hell, spirit appears to him. .  The spirit tells him that, rather than being judged for his sins, he gets to choose whether he goes to heaven or hell. The politician replies that of course he wants to go to heaven. The spirit tells him that before he chooses, he has to visit both places so each one will get fair chance. Firstthey visit heaven. It looks pretty nice. Big fluffy clouds, angels singing and playing harps, everyone seeming to enjoy themselves. The politician is pleased, if bit underwhelmed. Hell,on the other hand, is magnificent. It's the most beautiful place the politician has ever seen, and everyone there is having the time of their lives. It has buffet table filled with delicious-smelling food, beautiful garden, pool with water slide, dance floor, massage parlor, and innumerable other attractions. It makes heaven look dull and boring and comparison. Ican't believe I'm saying this, says the politician, but think I'd rather go to hell! Very well, says the spirit. Turn around. Whenthe politician turns around, though, hell appears to be completely different than it had been less than minute ago. All of the attractions are gone, everything is on fire, and the people are screaming in agony. Idon't understand! cries the politician. This isn't what you showed me before! Well,that was the campaign, replies the spirit.	Now you've voted.

Once upon time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived young monk named Sam. .  His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below. Samwas particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one. Andon Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings. Andon it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there. Suddenly,to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam. Thetownsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief. Themayor approached the lead monk of the order. What happened? he asked, exasperated. Theold monk shook his head sadly. Isn't it obvious? he said. Sam sung Note 7.- Wow, came back and this really blew up! Thanks so much for the kind comments, and upvotes, and gold.	I'm so glad could give so many people chuckle today!

There was man in Bulgaria who drove train for living... .  There was man in Bulgaria who drove train for living. Heloved his job, driving train had been his dream ever since he was child.

In crowded city at bus stop, beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in tight leather mini skirt, with matching tight leather boots and jacket... .  As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus. Slightly embarrassed and with quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't! So, little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt little more and for second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. With coy little smile to the driver, she again unzipped the offending skirt to give little more slack and again was unable to make the step. Aboutthis time, big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, How dare you touch my body!! don't even know who you are!	Atthis, the Texan drawled, Well ma'am normally would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, kinda figured that we was friends.

An ancient mathematical joke .  Once upon time, there were three kingdoms, all bordering on the same lake. For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. Thefirst kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. Thethird kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using looped rope, slung pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor. Thenext day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. Thebattle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.	Andit just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. .  Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented new machine that would transfer portion of the mother's labor pain to the father. He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it. Thedoctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. Thedoctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer the pain to him. The wife delivered healthy baby with virtually no pain. She and her husband were ecstatic.	Whenthey got home, the mailman was dead on the porch.

Before you get settled in he said, We have little problem…you see, we've never had manager make it this far before and we're not really sure what to do with you. Oh,see, said the woman, can't you just let me in? Well,I'd like to, said St Peter, But have higher orders. We're instructed to let you have day in hell and day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you'd like to go for all eternity. Actually,think I'd prefer heaven, said the woman. Sorry, we have rules… at which St. Peter put the manager into the downward bound elevator. Asthe doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto beautiful golf course. In the distance was country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times. Theyplayed perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had wonderful night telling jokes and dancing. Beforeshe knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. Now it's time to spend day in heaven, he said. Soshe spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day's end St. Peter returned. So, he said, You've spent day in hell and you've spent day in heaven. You must choose between the two. Thewoman thought for second and replied: Well, heaven is certainly lovely, but actually had better time in hell. choose Hell. Accordingly,St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her. Idon't understand, stuttered the manager, The other day was here, and there was golf course, and country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had wonderful happy time. Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.	TheDevil simply looked at her and smiled, Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you're staff.

They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off. The dentist wakes to knock on the door. Suspecting solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; full skeleton underneath tattered cloak. The grim reaper swears. Oh no! This always happens with identical twins. What do you mean? asks the dentist. Well... if you must know, your brother was in critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now. The dentist is noticeably upset. He says Wait! Isn't there some way can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, made the mistake. Certainly there must be way can bargain for his life. The grim reaper asks What do you have in mind? The dentist thinks. How about challenge? If beat you, you let my brother go free. The grim reaper laughs. will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose? The dentist smiles. propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. minutes of brushing each, then we decide. Very well says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom. Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance. The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like madman. When his minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles. It's unbelievable. The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth. The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. You win, human. This time. Your brother will live. He disappears in puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, went out to the market and got hit by car. They say almost died. The dentist smiles on the phone and says. That's interesting, bro.	Today you might say that also had brush with death.

Man wakes up in slum with no memory of how he got there. .  He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is. You'rein the afterlife! he tells the man, But you must have been real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here. Allof sudden, siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. guard in heavy body armor blows whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines. Thebeggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there. Sothe man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's bit below average for real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into familiar former beggar as he crosses the street. Whatare the odds? they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line. The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch. Whilehe's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it! Sadly,this proved not to be true. After only few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in glittering, clean city full of glass and steel. Andwouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. Come, the beggar told him, I'll take you to the evening meal. So the man followed and they entered glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line, and then he added, and apparently here, they change the meals times year! Theman rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for million dollars to pass. Well the man was bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. What is it, he thought, that could possibly be more wonderful than what have here? That question haunted him for weeks until he came to conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring. Fiftyyears later, he returned to the guards with million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same. Thebeggar laughed jovially. got here only three years ago myself, but somehow knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in! Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own. Smilingat the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. That's the line for the dragon meat, he said before turning to the next line, and that's the line for angeldust stew, then he paused, confused. Whatis it? the man asked his old friend.	Thebeggar replied, There appears to be no punchline.

Thenext morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can't tell you. You're not monk. Theman is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Someyears later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. Themonks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. Thenext morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can't tell you. You're not monk. Theman says, All right, all right. I'm dying to know. If the only way can find out what that sound was is to become monk, how do become monk? Themonks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become monk. Theman sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 pebbles on the earth. Themonks reply, Congratulations. You are now monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound. Themonks lead the man to wooden door, where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door. Theman reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, Real funny. May have the key? Themonks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behindthe wooden door is another door made of stone. Theman demands the key to the stone door. Themonks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find door made of ruby. Hedemands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behindthat door is another door, this one made of sapphire. Soit went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally,the monks say, This is the last key to the last door. Theman is relieved to no end. Heunlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.	Butcan't tell you what it is because you're not monk.

Pissedat the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said gruffly, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader or will fire! Theolder alien again warned his comrade saying, probably don't want to do that! really think that will make him mad.'' Rubbish,'replied the cocky, young alien. He aimed his weapon and opened fire. There was huge explosion. massive fireball roared towards him and blew the younger alien off his feet and threw him in burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in cactus patch. Halfan hour passed. When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head.' Whatferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien. damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?'	Theolder alien leaned over, placed friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you never mess with guy who can loop his dick over his shoulder twice and then stick it in his ear.'

An ancient mathematical joke .  Once upon time, there were three kingdoms, all bordering on the same lake. For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. Thefirst kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. Thethird kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using looped rope, slung pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor. Thenext day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. Thebattle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.	Andit just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. Thedoctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%.

Thethree people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside.

My village had signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.- Thisis preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?- W-well,don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.	(

Five friends were sitting around, debating which Pixar movie is the greatest .  After few hours of debate, no one was willing to concede, and it was decided that vote must be held. Unfortunately, with so few friends present, it was clear that they would need to bring the vote to the greater public. The group decided that each friend would make plea to the subreddit of their choice, and whoever received the most karma for it would win. Adam,already undecided himself, decided to go to /r/ AskReddit.He laid out the agreement, and asked that everyone vote one their favorite movie, and the one with the most votes he would use for the his friends. Unfortunately, as the votes were split in that sub, his highest post amounted to mere 38 points. Paul,big proponent for the Toy Story franchise, posted to /r/nostalgia in the hopes that everyone who grew up with Toy Story would agree. Unfortunately, as there had been two sequels (with third on the way) it wasn't exactly considered nostalgia and he got downvoted into oblivion. Bill,who loved Monsters Inc., made his case using some trickery. Going to /r/news, he found seemingly unrelated post, and made top-level comment describing, in great detail, why Monsters Inc. was the greatest film of all time. The fact that the post was so out of context made everyone flock to it, and drew enough attention to new him over thousand fake internet points. Mike,who loved the Incredibles movies, decided to stay in his wheelhouse. Over the course of several hours, he created each of the family members from the Incredibles in Soulcaliber Finally, he photoshopped the family together, and posted it to /r/gaming. Under normal circumstances this would have skyrocketed to the top, but the format was stale, and thus only received 20k karma. Still, Mike was confident in his victory. Whilethe other four friends came up with plans on how to maximize their karma gains, Chris sat silently. For hours he sat, making no posts, coming up with no original content. Finally, an hour before the deadline, he broke into his neighbor's house, stealing his copy of the Pixar movie Up. He took picture of his theft and posted it directly to /r/ Jokeswith the title the group got together the next day to see who got the most votes, everyone was in awe. Chris's post had over 40,000 points. How did you know that would win? Easy, Chris replied.	Everyone knows stolen content on /r/ Jokesgets all the Up votes.

married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. .

But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. Thedoctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer the pain to him. The wife delivered healthy baby with virtually no pain. She and her husband were ecstatic.	Whenthey got home, the mailman was dead on the porch.

Once upon time in an old magical kingdom, there lived an young monk called Sam... .  His order was renowned for their beautiful choralsinging.

Everyone withinmiles just froze in mid action, stirred to the verycore of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. Andall the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam,and Sam was the first person in historyto hit one of the rumored Magical Notes thatmusicians had theorized must exist... yet no onebefore Sam had ever reached one.

As the golden sound finallytapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam hadfound the Second Note... Andthe next year on Sam's birthday, the townhad realized there was pattern involved. Thistime, all of the townspeople were present in themonastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hitthe glorious Third Note. People cried out in purepurejoy as the sound grew to glorious crescendo. Wordscannot do justice to the experience. Thetown flourished, as Sam's notes made the peoplepure all the way to the core of their beings. Andon it went for the next few years, the Magical Notesgrowing sweeter and sweeter... until, thatis, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From thestart, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and thisnew sound was not beautiful... it was jarring anddiscordant. Sam started to get very warm, andwas visibly sweating onstage.

There was this tramp. .  One cold winter's morning he was walking along country road, when he heard cry for help from nearby lake. Withoutmoment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for car to flag down. Coincidentallythe father drives up. How can ever thank you sir? he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. Just name your price I'm wealthy man. Ah,well... stammers the tramp, ... uh, I'm little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out. Ohdear, says the father, don't carry much cash with me, only have ten pounds but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe. No!No! says the tramp, Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life that'll be plenty. Tenpounds, thinks the tramp, I'm rich! I'm rich! and off he goes to the town to buy himself holiday. Hefinds travel agent, walks in much to the disgust of the staff and goes up to the desk. I'll have one holiday please! Ahem,which holiday would sir like? asked the girl at the desk, forcing smile. Oh,any holiday don't mind, anything up to ten pounds, replies the tramp. TENYou'll get holiday for ten pounds, says the girl incredulously. Shegoes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There to her amazement she finds an old file. Wellyou'll never believe it, she says to the tramp, back in the shop. I've got you holiday its super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise and it costs ten pounds. Yippee!exclaims the tramp, I'll take it! Afew days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen. Getoff my ship ye dirty bum! shouts voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside. ButI've got my ticket!, responds the tramp, super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and want on! Wellokay, says the captain, but you can't come on just now, don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then. Sothe tramp finds himself quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep. Psst,says voice, waking him with start. It was the captain. Hurryup, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin. Thetramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship and what ship! Firstthey went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets pile. genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere. Thenthe second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens watertight door into tiny 7' 4' cabin, with hammock, bedside table, and an alarm clock. Sheerluxury! exclaimed the tramp, room of my very own. I'mglad you like it, replies the captain, but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise. Wellthe cruise began, and the tramp had whale of time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen... Thenone morning, week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below. Heclimbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what dive...! Perfectlypoised in the air, he hit the water without so much as ripple. Nowunknown to him, the captain who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp was standing watching this. Thatwas amazing! exclaimed the captain, Where did you learn to dive like that? Um,well I've never actually dived before, replied the tramp. Wellthat's incredible! says the captain, I've never seen... He broke off. Hey, I've got an idea, he started again. How would you like to train bit, and we'll put on show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class! It'sdeal! says our man. For the next weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it. Thenone morning the captain comes to talk. Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next days. We're going to erect high diving board for you. Okay,agreed the tramp. Twodays passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and hushed awe.

politician dies. Instead of going straight to heaven or hell, spirit appears to him. .  The spirit tells him that, rather than being judged for his sins, he gets to choose whether he goes to heaven or hell. The politician replies that of course he wants to go to heaven. The spirit tells him that before he chooses, he has to visit both places so each one will get fair chance. Firstthey visit heaven. It looks pretty nice. Big fluffy clouds, angels singing and playing harps, everyone seeming to enjoy themselves. The politician is pleased, if bit underwhelmed. Hell,on the other hand, is magnificent. It's the most beautiful place the politician has ever seen, and everyone there is having the time of their lives. It has buffet table filled with delicious-smelling food, beautiful garden, pool with water slide, dance floor, massage parlor, and innumerable other attractions. It makes heaven look dull and boring and comparison. Ican't believe I'm saying this, says the politician, but think I'd rather go to hell! Very well, says the spirit. Turn around. Whenthe politician turns around, though, hell appears to be completely different than it had been less than minute ago. All of the attractions are gone, everything is on fire, and the people are screaming in agony. Idon't understand! cries the politician. This isn't what you showed me before! Well,that was the campaign, replies the spirit.	Now you've voted.

An ancient mathematical joke .  Once upon time, there were three kingdoms, all bordering on the same lake. For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. Thefirst kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. Thethird kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using looped rope, slung pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor. Thenext day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. Thebattle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.	Andit just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

Thenthe old man took some bread and gave it to Attila. Nowhold these in both hands, he instructed.

Once again, he caused train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room and the man was once again unharmed.

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. Theman looked at the executioner and said, Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just bad conductor.

Stoner Joke. Three Men Died and Went to Hell Where They Met the Devil. Long one) .  Three men died and went to hell where they met the Devil. The Devil told them that they had sinned in life and therefore had to spend the next 666 years in hell to atone for their sins. However, since the Devil wasn't entirely merciless, he would let them choose for themselves how they were going to spend those 666 years. And so the Devil let the men to three doors. Goingthrough the first door, they entered what looked to be normal bar. Although, if you were there for more than an hour, you would notice that no matter how much you tried to drink another bottle would appear on the shelf. And even better, the bar always had the exact drink you wanted available. An unlimited supply of every alcoholic beverage in existence. It was, in short, drunkard's paradise. Whenthey entered the second door, they were greeted by myriad of women all ready to satisfy every sexual desire they could possible have. There were multiple women of every shape, size and ethnicity imaginable. Looking closer you would notice that there were even celebrity and work crushes from your life in the crowd. Every single one of them ready to please you. It was, in short, pervert's paradise Finally,when they entered the third door, they found themselves in forest made of cannabis. The ground was made of kief, all the bushes wore beatiful buds and even the trees were 20 feet tall cannabis plants. There were every strain it has or ever will be possible to grow. You could even find rocks of hashish laying around the forest floor if you looked closely. It was, in short, stoner's paradise. TheDevil asked the men which room they each wanted. The words had barely left the Devil's mouth before the first man ran directly to the room with myriad of women. The second man then went to the room with the bar, thinking that if he was going to spend 666 years in hell, he might as well be drunk for most of it. Lastly, the third man, thinking he had won the lottery, gladly went towards the room with the forest of cannabis.666 years later, the Devil returned to see if the men had atoned for their sins. Whenhe opened the first door, bottles slowly rolled out and you could immediately smell piss and puke coming from the room. It took the Devil while, but he finally found the man nestled between the bottles, smeared in his own shit and puke, and with arguably the worst hangover in history. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out. Whenhe opened the second door, he was overwhelmed with the sound of hundreds of crying children and angry women. Not ten seconds after the door opened, the man came running, pleading for the Devil to please let him out. There were kids of every age running around screaming and all the women were angry at each other, while everyone, children and mothers alike, were angry at the man. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out. Whenthe Devil opened the third door, he immediately saw the man sitting cross legged in giant pool of his own tears. The Devil had not expected this. Confused, he went to ask the man what was wrong.	The man, tears still running down his face, looked up at the Devil and said: Idon't have lighter

perfectly triangular lake has kingdoms on its sides .  perfectly triangular lake has kingdoms on its sides. The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army. Thekingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets rope and swings it over the branch of tall tree, making noose, and hangs pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing the squire from the third kingdom.	And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

Man wakes up in slum with no memory of how he got there. .  He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is. You'rein the afterlife! he tells the man, But you must have been real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here. Allof sudden, siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. guard in heavy body armor blows whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines. Thebeggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there. Sothe man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's bit below average for real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into familiar former beggar as he crosses the street. Whatare the odds? they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line. The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch. Whilehe's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it! Sadly,this proved not to be true. After only few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in glittering, clean city full of glass and steel. Andwouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. Come, the beggar told him, I'll take you to the evening meal. So the man followed and they entered glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line, and then he added, and apparently here, they change the meals times year! Theman rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for million dollars to pass. Well the man was bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. What is it, he thought, that could possibly be more wonderful than what have here? That question haunted him for weeks until he came to conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring. Fiftyyears later, he returned to the guards with million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same. Thebeggar laughed jovially. got here only three years ago myself, but somehow knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in! Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own. Smilingat the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. That's the line for the dragon meat, he said before turning to the next line, and that's the line for angeldust stew, then he paused, confused. Whatis it? the man asked his old friend.	Thebeggar replied, There appears to be no punchline.
