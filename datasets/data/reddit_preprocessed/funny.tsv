In a crowded city at a bus stop, a beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in a tight leather mini skirt, with matching tight leather boots and jacket... As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus. Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't! So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. With a coy little smile to the driver, she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step.About this time, a big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, How dare you touch my body!!	I don't even know who you are!At this, the Texan drawled, Well ma'am normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends.

Little Bobby was running through the woods.  behind his house when the urge to go #2 struck. Bobby did his business behind a tree and carried on his way. The next day, Bobby was out behind his house again when he saw a swarm of flies circling yesterday's droppings. Intrigued, Bobby dropped his pants and did his business in the exact same spot in hopes of seeing how many flies he could gather. After a couple weeks of doing this, Bobby had created a rather tall pile of dung. So tall, in fact, that he now needed to use a step ladder to make sure he had a stable poo-pole developing. A curious neighbor caught sight of Bobby doing this, and after confronting Bobby, the neighbor punched Bobby in the face and told him to grow the hell up. Over the next few days, word of Bobby's droppings had spread around town. It started with just a few people a day coming up to Bobby, punching him in the face, and telling him the errs of his way. It wasn't long until there was a line of over 50 people waiting to see Bobby's poo-pole and to subsequently punch him in the face. The line moved pretty slowly, however, and someone towards the back of the line had to take care of some business of his own. Not wanting to leave his spot, he dropped his pants answered nature's call right then and there. The stench of his droppings spread quickly throughout the line. One gentleman towards the front of the line caught its stench when he saw Bobby's creation, admiration spreading across his face.	The man at the front of the line turned around and said that was a good shit post, but this punchline stinks.

This is the dirty joke my 85yo grandad told to our whole family by memory. A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship. The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink. They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore. At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him.	Look, she said, I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.

A gambler dies and goes to Heaven... A professional gambler wins big and dies of an aneurysm.

He taps the old man ahead of him on the shoulder...Want to make a bet while we wait? The Gambler asks. If I can guess your last words in three tries, you have to let me cut ahead of you.The old man, having nothing better to do, agrees. Immediately, the gambler begins reading him like the pro player he is. He notices the elderly Asian man's shirt is open, exposing a pair of defibrillator marks.Don't be silly, it's just indigestion. the gambler remarks. The old man looks a bit surprised, then steps aside, giving up his place in line.Next, the gambler taps on a redneck's shoulder. He makes the same bet, and the redneck also accepts.This one's easy! the gambler smirks, sizing up the bruised, bloody, grass stained redneck with the caved in skull. Hold my beer!Muttering profanities, the redneck begrudgingly steps aside and gives up his place in line.Riding the high of a hot streak, the gambler wastes no time tapping the next man ahead of him on the shoulder. He quickly makes the same bet, and is ecstatic when the agreement is made.Okay, let's see... The gambler studies the new mark carefully. He's a large, imposing black man riddled with several bullet holes.The gambler holds his hand out like a gun. You ain't taking me alive!The man shakes his head. Wrong. The gambler strokes his chin. The guy is giving him nothing else to work with.The gambler holds the 'gun' sideways, makes a mean face, and shouts, Fuck the police!Wrong again. The gambler's getting frustrated, now. He's never been unable to read someone before.Finally, the gambler throws his hands in the air. I'VE GOT NOTHING! He shouts.	I GIVE UP!The man steps aside.

Unbutton my blouse.. A successful rancher died and left everything to his devoted wife. She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand... Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk. She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.. For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well. Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels. The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night. One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return. Two o'clock and no hired hand. Finally he returned around two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him. She quietly called him over to her.. Unbutton my blouse and take it off, she said. Trembling, he did as she directed. Now take off my boots. He did as she asked, ever so slowly.. Now take off my socks. He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots. Now take off my skirt. He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light. Now take off my bra.. Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.	Then she looked at him and said, If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired.

Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community... If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each otherThe Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.The Rabbi pulled out an apple.With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue! 'Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.	'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'

Take us to your leader.The gas pump, of course, didn't respond.The younger alien became angry at the lack of response.The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you.

Donald Trump was visiting a primary school and he visited one of the classes. They were in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings. The teacher asked the President if he would like to lead the discussion on the word tragedy. So the illustrious leader asked the class for an example of a tragedy. One little boy stood up and offered: If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs over him and kills him, that would be a tragedy. No, said Trump, that would be an accident A little girl raised her hand: If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy. I’m afraid not, explained the president. That’s what we would call great loss. The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Trump searched the room. Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? Finally at the back of the room a small boy raised his hand... In a quiet voice he said: If ‘Air Force One’ was carrying you and was struck by a friendly fire missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy. Fantastic! exclaimed Trump. That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be tragedy?	Well, said the boy, It has to be a tragedy, because it certainly wouldn’t be a great loss, and it probably wouldn’t be a fucking accident either.

A DEA agent stopped at our farm yesterday. We are going to need to search your land for illegally grown drugs.I said, that’s fine, but don’t go into that field over there. You won’t like it.Agitated by this, the officer explodes saying, do you see this god damn badge son?! This badge means I can go where I please, when I please, how I please! You have no authority when it comes to telling me where the fuck I can go! Have I made myself clear, boy? !I politely nodded and went back about my business. A short time after, I heard a scream, looked up to see the DEA agent being chased by my big old mean bull. Every step, gaining, closing the gap between himself and the agent. It seemed as tho he would surely get gored before returning to safety. The officer was clearly terrified. I threw down my tools, ran to the fence and screamed at the top of my lungs....YOUR BADGE!

An elderly woman walked into the Royal Bank of Ireland one morning with a purse full of money.  She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money. After many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office. The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'. The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money . The elderly woman replied that she made bets. The president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?' The elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.' The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that. The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?' 'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.' 'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.' 'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently. That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that way, up and down, turned it around, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet. The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square  The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly. The president was happy to oblige. The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.' The elderly woman did so with a little smile.	Suddenly the president noticed that the \*lawyer was banging his head against the wall.\*  He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, 'Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock this morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Royal Bank of Ireland '

A husband notices his wife’s hearing is deteriorating and decides to visit her doctor for advice. I can’t speak to my wife directly as she might find it offensive, given our old age he says to the doc. There’s a simple trick you can try to determine her hearing explains the doctor. Simply ask her a question at a distance and if she doesn’t hear you, move slightly closer and ask again until she does. That night, the husband arrives home and sees his wife in the kitchen cooking. He thinks to himself, what a perfect opportunity to test her hearing. He stands in the doorway of the kitchen and promptly asks;What’s for dinner honey?No answer. He moves closer. What’s for dinner honey?Still no answer. He moves even closer. What’s for dinner honey?Still his wife doesn’t answer. He now sees how serious her hearing problem is. At this point, he is stood right next to his wife.	What’s for dinner honey?FOR THE FOURTH FUCKING TIME WE’RE HAVING CHICKEN

An 18 year old Italian girl tells her Mom that she has missed her period for two months.......  Very worried, the mother goes to the drugstore and buys a pregnancy kit. The test result shows that the girl is pregnant. Shouting, cursing, crying, the mother says, Who was the pig that did this to you? I want to know! The girl picks up the phone and makes a call.Half an hour later, a Ferrari stops in front of their house. A mature and distinguished man with gray hair and impeccably dressed in an Armani suit steps out of the of the Ferrari and enters the house.He sits in the living room with the father, mother, and the girl and tells them: Good morning, your daughter has informed me of the problem. I can't marry her because of my personal family situation but I'll take charge. I will pay all costs and provide for your daughter for the rest of her life. Additionally, if a girl is born, I will bequeath a Ferrari, a beach house, two retail stores, a townhouse, a beachfront villa, and a $2,000,000 bank account. If a boy is born, my legacy will be a couple of factories and a $4,000,000 bank account. If twins, they will receive a factory and $2,000,000 each.	However, if there is a miscarriage, what do you suggest I do?At this point, the father, who had remained silent, places a hand firmly on the man's shoulder and tells him, You fuck her again.

Little Bobby was running through the woods.  behind his house when the urge to go #2 struck. Bobby did his business behind a tree and carried on his way. The next day, Bobby was out behind his house again when he saw a swarm of flies circling yesterday's droppings. Intrigued, Bobby dropped his pants and did his business in the exact same spot in hopes of seeing how many flies he could gather. After a couple weeks of doing this, Bobby had created a rather tall pile of dung. So tall, in fact, that he now needed to use a step ladder to make sure he had a stable poo-pole developing. A curious neighbor caught sight of Bobby doing this, and after confronting Bobby, the neighbor punched Bobby in the face and told him to grow the hell up. Over the next few days, word of Bobby's droppings had spread around town. It started with just a few people a day coming up to Bobby, punching him in the face, and telling him the errs of his way. It wasn't long until there was a line of over 50 people waiting to see Bobby's poo-pole and to subsequently punch him in the face. The line moved pretty slowly, however, and someone towards the back of the line had to take care of some business of his own. Not wanting to leave his spot, he dropped his pants answered nature's call right then and there. The stench of his droppings spread quickly throughout the line. One gentleman towards the front of the line caught its stench when he saw Bobby's creation, admiration spreading across his face.	The man at the front of the line turned around and said that was a good shit post, but this punchline stinks.

The Italian Lover, a virile middle aged Italian gentlemen named Guido was relaxing at his favorite bar in Rome when he managed to attract a spectacular young blond woman. Things progressed to the point where he led her back to his apartment and, after some small talk, they retired to his bedroom where he fucked her senseless.After a pleasant interlude, he asked with a smile, So, you finish?She paused for a second, frowned, and replied. No.Surprised, Guido reached for her and the fucking resumed. This time she thrashed about wildly and there were screams of passion.It finally ended and, again, Guido smiled and asked, You finish?Again, after a short pause, she returned his smile, cuddled closer to him and softly said, No.Stunned, but damned if he was going to leave this woman unsatisfied, Guido reached for the woman yet again.Using the last of his strength, he barely managed it, but they ended together screaming, bucking, clawing and ripping the bed sheets.Exhausted, Guido fell onto his back, gasping. Barely able to turn his head, he looked into her eyes, smiled proudly and asked again, You finish?	?Barely able to speak, the beautiful blonde whispered in his ear… No, I Norwegian.

The year is 1804 and a young man enlists on a ship.. ..his first voyage is to last 3 years, and even though the work is hard the young man takes to it like a fish in water.After only a few days he is running the riggin like an old hand, he swabs the decks without complaint and spends his free time in amicable companionship playing cards or telling tall tales.All in all the young man feels as if he has found his calling.A few weeks go by like this, the young man loving his new life except one part.. There are no women.After a couple of months like this, he is starting to feel extremely uncomfortable with the situation and voices his complaints to his shipmates one evening.Why don't you just use the barrel? Asks one of his mates with a surprised look .It turns out that down in the hold, in a dark corner there is a barrel, with a hole drilled into the side.. Whenever the sailors start to feel their urges rise, they simply go down to the barrel and take care of their business there.The young man decides, with some scepticism, to try the barrel, and finds to his surprise that it is a wholly pleasant experience, in no way lesser than any he has had with real women before.With this new found release the young man starts to enjoy his work even more. His days continue as before, and his evenings are still spent in pleasant company, but a new addition to his routine is a nightly visit to the barrel.Another two months pass in this way and all is well, until one night as he gets up from his seat at the card table and announces that he is going to visit the barrel to his mates.A few chuckles greet this announcement and one of his friends asks Trying to get the final fun out of it eh?Final fun? Are we getting rid of the barrel?	The young man asks, worry playing over his face.Not at all mate, it's just that.. next month is your turn in the barrel.

There was this tramp. One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.Coincidentally the father drives up. How can I ever thank you sir? he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.Ah, well... stammers the tramp, ... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.Oh dear, says the father, I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.No! No! says the tramp, Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.Ten pounds, thinks the tramp, I'm rich! I'm rich! and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. I'll have one holiday please!Ahem, which holiday would sir like? asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds, replies the tramp.TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds, says the girl incredulously.She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.Well you'll never believe it, she says to the tramp, back in the shop. I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.Yippee! exclaims the tramp, I'll take it!A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.Get off my ship ye dirty bum! shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.But I've got my ticket!, responds the tramp, super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!Well okay, says the captain, but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.Psst, says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6 pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3 deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.Sheer luxury! exclaimed the tramp, A room of my very own.I'm glad you like it, replies the captain, but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what a dive...!Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.That was amazing! exclaimed the captain, Where did you learn to dive like that?Um, well I've never actually dived before, replied the tramp.Well that's incredible! says the captain, I've never seen... He broke off. Hey, I've got an idea, he started again. How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!It's a deal! says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.Then one morning the captain comes to talk. Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.Okay, agreed the tramp.Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.Well, tramp, said the captain, shaking his hand, Let's see what you can do. And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...up and up...below him the ship grew smaller...on and on...past a solitary albatross...and still higher...till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...and on still further.../ till the ocean grew dim...and the earth itself...began to shrink...past our moon...and on...and Mars...and on...higher, and higher...through the asteroid belt...and on and on towards the diving board...past the outer planets, until...on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...he reached the board.He climbed on top and radioed the captain...and then....' '.. .. .he jumped.....:Slowly at first,:but speeding up,:::faster, and faster,:speeding past Pluto,:and the other outer planets,.........through the asteroid belt,past Mars,and the moon,faster,and faster,faster - ever faster,and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,faster, and faster,past the albatross,double-back somersault,and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,I CAN SEE HIM! yelled a passenger, LOOK!! !The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!DOWN!DOWN!THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!STILL DOWN...!DEEPER,DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,TILL.........SMASH!Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.Up and up, desperate, gasping...Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.HERO! WONDERFUL! AMAZING! GOOD SHOW THAT!And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.The tramp blushed.The captain went on, but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: Well you see...For me to tell you, I'll need $49.95The captain outrageously asked why.The tramp said The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes, As for cost, we selected initial values based upon data from the Open Beta and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch.	Among other things, we’re looking at average per-player credit earn rates on a daily basis, and we’ll be making constant adjustments to ensure that players have challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via gameplay.We appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on Reddit, our forums and across numerous social media outlets.Our team will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update everyone as soon and as often as we can.

An easy question to Albert Einstein! One day, Einstein has to speak at an important science conference.On the way there, he tells his driver that looks a bit like him: I'm sick of all these conferences. I always say the same things over and over!The driver agrees: You're right. As your driver, I attended all of them, and even though I don't know anything about science, I could give the conference in your place. That's a great idea! says Einstein. Let's switch places then! So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it. But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.	The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says : Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.

The only survivor is the kid named 90. 90 grows up and has kids of her own. One day, the kids find a stray dog. 90 did not want them to keep it. The kids decide to keep the dog secretly. They name the dog this so that they can say things like Let’s take this outside without 90 finding out. One day, this suddenly dies in a car accident.Only 90’s kids remember this.edit: you know how people on reddit say wow, this blew up. well this really *did* blow up, holy moly.	this is where I peak in my reddit career lmao.edit 2: short explanation to the people who didn’t get this: only the mother’s (ninety’s) kids will remember this, the dog
One day in the future, Donald Trump has a heart-attack and dies. He immediately goes to Hell, where the devil is waiting for him. I don't know what to do here, says the devil.You are on my list, but I have no room for you. You definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I've got three folks here who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU decide who leaves.Donald thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room.In it, was Richard Nixon and a  large pool of water. Nixon kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed. Over, and over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. Such was his fate in  hell.No, Donald said. I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and it would ruin my hair. I don't think I could do that all day  long.The devil led him to the door of the next room. In it, was Ronald Reagan with a sledge-hammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that  hammer, time after time after time. No, this is no good; I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day, commented Donald.The devil opened a third door. Through it, Donald saw Bill Clinton, lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head, and his legs restrained in a spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.	Donald looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said, Yeah man, I can handle this.The devil smiled and said, Okay: Monica, you're free to go.

Your DUCK IS DEAD. A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest.After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.The distressed woman wailed, Are you sure?Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead, replied the vet..How can you be so sure? she protested.. I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.The vet looked at the woman and said, I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. $1,500! she cried,$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!The vet shrugged, I'm sorry.	If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500.

Once upon a time there lived a beautiful Queen with large breasts. Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.The moral of the story - Pay your bills !	!

There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living... There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.The man was perfectly fine.Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just a bad conductor.

A policeman was interrogating 3 guys who were training to become detectives. To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first guys a picture for 5 seconds and then hides it. This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?The first guy answers, That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye! The policeman says, Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile.Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?The second guy smiles, flips his hair, and says, Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!The policeman angrily responds, What's the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, This is your suspect, how would you recognize him? He quickly adds, Think hard before giving me a stupid answer.The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, the suspect wears contact lenses.The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not. Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that. He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?That's easy, the third guy replied.	He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear.

One day in the future, Donald Trump has a heart-attack and dies. He immediately goes to Hell, where the devil is waiting for him. I don't know what to do here, says the devil.You are on my list, but I have no room for you. You definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I've got three folks here who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place.

I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day, commented Donald.The devil opened a third door.

Donald looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said, Yeah man, I can handle this.The devil smiled and said, Okay: Monica, you're free to go.

This is the dirty joke my 85yo grandad told to our whole family by memory. A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship. The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink. They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore. At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him.	Look, she said, I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.

The man answers  I think the handbrake is as well, your car went down the hill about five minutes ago

I always complimented him on the newest addition to his collection.When he died a couple of years ago, he bequeathed them to me in his will.

You’re not a monk.The man says, All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk.

He says, Real funny.	May I have the key?The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.The man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk

A politician dies. Instead of going straight to heaven or hell, a spirit appears to him. The spirit tells him that, rather than being judged for his sins, he gets to choose whether he goes to heaven or hell. The politician replies that of course he wants to go to heaven. The spirit tells him that before he chooses, he has to visit both places so each one will get a fair chance.First they visit heaven. It looks pretty nice. Big fluffy clouds, angels singing and playing harps, everyone seeming to enjoy themselves. The politician is pleased, if a bit underwhelmed.Hell, on the other hand, is magnificent. It’s the most beautiful place the politician has ever seen, and everyone there is having the time of their lives. It has a buffet table filled with delicious-smelling food, a beautiful garden, a pool with a water slide, a dance floor, a massage parlor, and innumerable other attractions. It makes heaven look dull and boring and comparison.I can’t believe I’m saying this, says the politician, but I think I’d rather go to hell! Very well, says the spirit. Turn around.When the politician turns around, though, hell appears to be completely different than it had been less than a minute ago. All of the attractions are gone, everything is on fire, and the people are screaming in agony.I don’t understand! cries the politician.

He seemed more amused. When on the fourth move, the man burst out laughing, she complained to the driver and he had the man arrested.The case came up in court. The Judge asked the man (about 20 years old) what he had to say for himself.The man replied...Well your Honor, it was like this: When the lady got on the bus, I couldn't help but notice her condition.	She sat under a sweets sign that said, The Double Mint Twins are Coming and I grinned.Then she moved and sat under a sign that said Logan's Liniment will reduce the swelling, and I had to smile.Then she placed herself under a deodorant sign that said William's Big Stick Did the Trick, and I could hardly contain myself.BUT, your Honor, when she moved for the fourth time and sat under the sign that said Goodyear Rubber could have prevented this Accident..... it was then that I.... lost it

In a crowded city at a bus stop, a beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in a tight leather mini skirt, with matching tight leather boots and jacket... As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus. Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't! So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. With a coy little smile to the driver, she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step.About this time, a big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, How dare you touch my body!!	I don't even know who you are!At this, the Texan drawled, Well ma'am normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends.
I broke up with my Thai girlfriend today. 	She was a little bit too cocky for my taste.
A policeman was interrogating 3 guys who were training to become detectives. To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first guys a picture for 5 seconds and then hides it. This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?The first guy answers, That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye! The policeman says, Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile.Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?The second guy smiles, flips his hair, and says, Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!The policeman angrily responds, What's the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, This is your suspect, how would you recognize him? He quickly adds, Think hard before giving me a stupid answer.The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, the suspect wears contact lenses.The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not. Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that. He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?That's easy, the third guy replied.	He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear.

Before I called her back my aunt called, told me that my cousin was lying and not to give her the money. She goes on to say that the real reason my cousin wanted the £300.00 was to get her boyfriend out of jail so she could be under the same roof as him for his birthday. I was mad when I heard that, but I thought about it for a minute ...decided to give her the £300.00 because we all need help at times. So, I called my cousin told her to come get the money.

A woman joins a country club and when she hears the guys talking about their golf round, she says, I played on my college's golf team. I was pretty good. Mind if I join you next week? No one wants to say 'yes', but they're on the spot.  Finally, one man says, Okay, but we start at 6:30 a.m.He figures the early tee-time will discourage her.The woman says this may be a problem and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late.They roll their eyes, but say, Okay.She's there at 6:30 am. sharp and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round.She's fun and pleasant and the guys are impressed.They congratulate her and invite her back the next week.She smiles, and says, I'll be there at 6:30, or 6:45.The next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp.Only this time, she plays left-handed.The three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand.They're totally amazed.They can't figure her out.She's very pleasant and a gracious winner.They invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.The third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys.This week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them.The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part.However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.This woman is a riddle no one can figure out.They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse and finally, one of the men asks her, How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?The lady blushes, and grins. When my dad taught me to play golf, I learned that I was ambidextrous. she replies. I like to switch back and forth.When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him.

Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community... If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each otherThe Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.The Rabbi pulled out an apple.With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue! 'Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.	'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'

Five friends were sitting around, debating which Pixar movie is the greatest. After a few hours of debate, no one was willing to concede, and it was decided that a vote must be held. Unfortunately, with so few friends present, it was clear that they would need to bring the vote to the greater public. The group decided that each friend would make a plea to the subreddit of their choice, and whoever received the most karma for it would win.Adam, already undecided himself, decided to go to /r/AskReddit. He laid out the agreement, and asked that everyone vote one their favorite movie, and the one with the most votes he would use for the his friends. Unfortunately, as the votes were split in that sub, his highest post amounted to a mere 38 points.Paul, a big proponent for the Toy Story franchise, posted to /r/nostalgia in the hopes that everyone who grew up with Toy Story would agree. Unfortunately, as there had been two sequels (with a third on the way) it wasn't exactly considered nostalgia and he got downvoted into oblivion.Bill, who loved Monsters Inc., made his case using some trickery. Going to /r/news, he found a seemingly unrelated post, and made a top-level comment describing, in great detail, why Monsters Inc. was the greatest film of all time. The fact that the post was so out of context made everyone flock to it, and drew enough attention to new him over a thousand fake internet points.Mike, who loved the Incredibles movies, decided to stay in his wheelhouse. Over the course of several hours, he created each of the family members from the Incredibles in Soulcaliber VI. Finally, he photoshopped the family together, and posted it to /r/gaming. Under normal circumstances this would have skyrocketed to the top, but the format was stale, and thus only received 20k karma. Still, Mike was confident in his victory.While the other four friends came up with plans on how to maximize their karma gains, Chris sat silently. For hours he sat, making no posts, coming up with no original content. Finally, an hour before the deadline, he broke into his neighbor's house, stealing his copy of the Pixar movie Up. He took a picture of his theft and posted it directly to /r/Jokes with the title STOLEN.When the group got together the next day to see who got the most votes, everyone was in awe. Chris's post had over 40,000 points. How did you know that would win? Easy, Chris replied.	Everyone knows stolen content on /r/Jokes gets all the Up votes.

My Patient just told me this joke and i can't stop laughing. George was turning 90 this week and his friends thought of doing something special for him. So they planned to contact a high class Escort service and send him a nice surprise. On his birthday, around 9 pm, when he was alone at home, the doorbell rang. George thought - who could it be ?Then the doorbell rang again. He got up and walked up to the door. As he opened the door, he was greeted by this young bombshell blonde, donned in a sexy little red dress with matching red lipstick and red heels.	As he says Hi,she replies - Are you George ?He says- Yes, I am.She says - I am from SuperSex.George pauses for a minute.And then says nonchalantly, I'll have the soup please.

Walking through the forest, an atheist hears a rustling in the bushes. Turning, he sees a massive grizzly charging towards him! He runs as fast as he can but trips over a stump and falls. As the bear raises a huge paw to strike, the atheist screams: God! Help me!Time freezes. The bear becomes immobile, the forest is silent, and the river stops running. Then the atheist hears a powerful voice: You have denied my existence for years, taught others I don’t exist and credited my creation to a cosmic accident. Why should I help you? It would be hypocritical to ask you to show mercy on me, the atheist agrees. But perhaps you could make the bear a Christian?	At that, the noise of the forest resumes, the river runs, and the bear drops to its knees, brings its paws together, and says, Lord, for this food which I am about to receive, I am truly thankful.

Three years ago I mistakenly bought my son a giant conch shell…. I have a son who’s on the spectrum. It’s quite common for people like him to latch onto one specific topic and become an absolute encyclopedia about it. Some people choose trains, some a cartoon. For my son, this was mollusks. Interesting topic I know, but it seemed to be a pretty good deal for us because it meant he’d get really excited about going outside to the beach which we figured was healthier than staying inside all the time. He’d always have a shell with him, or in his pocket. Usually he doesn’t want to talk much, but if you opened the conversation to it, he’d sit there rattling off facts about mollusks for hours. This was shaping up to be a long term passion, so for his 15th birthday I went out and bought him a giant conch shell. He absolutely loved it. The texture, holding it to his ear etc. It was too big to carry around with him all the time, but he kept it by his bed. Fast forward three years, this is where things get weird. About a month ago I was cleaning his room and picked up the conch to dust it off, something I’ve never actually done before. I was immediately hit by a terrible smell – I don’t want to get too into the gross details but I’m a dude, a once 18 year old dude, so I know what happens when you use something to masturbate and don’t clean it. I’m sure we all know what that smells like even after a week. It was pretty clear he had been using this shell as a kind of Strombidae fleshlight for a long, long time without cleaning it. I’m not going to share too much about what happened when this all came to light, but we tried taking it away and my god you’d think we just took his whole world. We decided to give the shell back, but worried this reflected a deeper issue my partner and I decided to get some professional help. So it’s been about a month of him seeing a behavioural therapist, and she recently asked me about his progress at home. I told her it’s been incredibly promising so far.	He’s really starting to come out of his shell.
A man escapes from prison where he's been for 15 years. He breaks in to a house looking for money, guns, and/or a car, instead he finds a young couple in bed. He orders the husband out of the bed and ties him to a chair. After tying the wife to the bed he gets on top of her and kisses her neck, then goes in to the bathroom. At which time the husband tells his wife: Honey, this man's an escaped convict, look at his clothes! I saw the way he kissed your neck, he probably hasn't seen a woman in years, if he wants sex give to him, don't resist, don't complain, just go with it no matter how sick It makes you. He's probably dangerous, if he gets mad he will most likely kill us. Honey, I love you, be strong. To which the wife responds: Oooh, honey, no? He wasn't kissing my neck he was whispering in my ear. He said you looked very cute and asked if we had any vasoline. I told him yeah in the restroom.	Give him what he wants, honey be strong i love you too.

You see, a deceased gentleman of about your husband's size was brought in shortly after you left yesterday, and he was wearing an attractive blue suit.

Three girls all worked in the same office with the same female boss. Each day, they noticed the boss left work early. One day, the girls decided that, when the boss left, they would leave right behind her. After all, she never called or came back to work, so how would she know if they went home early? The brunette was thrilled to be home early. She did a little gardening, spent playtime with her son, and went to bed early. The redhead was elated to be able to get in a quick workout at the spa before meeting a dinner date. The blonde was happy to get home early and surprise her husband, but when she got to her bedroom, she heard a muffled noise from inside. Slowly and quietly, she cracked open the door and was mortified to see her husband in bed with her boss! Gently she closed the door and crept out of her house. The next day, at their coffee break,the brunette and redhead planned to leave early again,and they asked the blonde if she was going to go with them. No way, the blonde exclaimed.

As a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: 5 lamb chops, please.  Amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop. He follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and trot across the road to a bus-stop. The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench. When a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus. The butcher follows, dumbstruck. As the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery. After awhile he stands on his back paws to push the stop bell, then the butcher follows him off. The dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step. He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door. He does this again and again. No answer. So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window, jumps off, and waits at the front door. A big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog. The butcher runs up and screams at the guy: What the hell are you doing? This dog's a genius! The owner responds, Genius, my ass.........	It's the second time this week he's forgotten his keys!

A man walks into a bar and asks the bartender,   If I show you a really good trick, will you give me a free drink? The bartender considers it, then agrees. The man reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tiny rat. He reaches into his other pocket and pulls out a tiny piano. The rat stretches, cracks his knuckles, and proceeds to play the blues. The bartender pours the man a drink on the house and he puts the rat and piano away. After the man finished his drink, he asked the bartender, If I show you an even better trick, will you give me free drinks for the rest of the evening? The bartender agrees, thinking that no trick could possibly be better than the first. The man reaches into his pockets again and pulls out the tiny rat and tiny piano. The rat stretches, cracks his knuckles, and proceeds to play the blues. The man reaches into a third pocket and pulls out a small bullfrog, who begins to sing along with the rat's music. While the man is enjoying his beverages, a stranger confronts him and offers him $100,000.00 for the bullfrog. Sorry, the man replies, he's not for sale. The stranger increases the offer to $250,000.00 cash up front. No, he insists, he's not for sale. The stranger again increases the offer, this time to $500,000.00 cash. The man finally agrees, and turns the frog over to the stranger in exchange for the money. Are you insane? the bartender demanded. That frog could have been worth millions to you, and you let him go for a mere $500,000! Don't worry about it, the man answered. The frog was nothing special.	You see, the rat's a ventriloquist.

The Devil says, Things are great down here since you sent us an engineer. What? says God. An engineer? I didn't send you one of those. That must have been a mistake. Send him upstairs immediately. The Devil responds, No way. We want to keep our engineer. We like him. God demands, If you don't send him to me immediately, I'll sue! The Devil laughs.	Where are YOU going to get a lawyer?

An elderly woman walked into the Royal Bank of Ireland one morning with a purse full of money.  She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money. After many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office. The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'. The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money . The elderly woman replied that she made bets. The president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?' The elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.' The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that. The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?' 'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.' 'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.' 'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently. That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that way, up and down, turned it around, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet. The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square  The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly. The president was happy to oblige. The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.' The elderly woman did so with a little smile.	Suddenly the president noticed that the \*lawyer was banging his head against the wall.\*  He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, 'Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock this morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Royal Bank of Ireland '

The guy is giving him nothing else to work with.The gambler holds the 'gun' sideways, makes a mean face, and shouts, Fuck the police!Wrong again. The gambler's getting frustrated, now. He's never been unable to read someone before.Finally, the gambler throws his hands in the air. I'VE GOT NOTHING! He shouts.	I GIVE UP!The man steps aside.

The gynecologist who became a mechanic! A gynecologist had become fed up with malpractice insurance and HMO paperwork, and was burned out.

He went to the local technical college, signed up for evening classes, attended diligently, and learned all he could. When the time of the practical exam approached, the gynecologist prepared carefully for weeks, and completed the exam with tremendous skill. When theresults came back, he was surprised to find that he had obtained a score of 150%. Fearing an error, he called the Instructor, saying, I don’t want to appear ungrateful for such an outstanding result, but I wonder if there is an error in the grade?

You put the engine back together again perfectly, which is also worth 50% of the mark.	After a pause, the instructor added, I gave you an extra 50% because you did it all through the muffler, which I’ve never seen done in my entire career.

A man goes to heaven, and to his surprise, he sees a huge wall covered in clocks. A man goes to heaven, and after walking through the gates, he gets escorted to a waiting room. In the room, he sees a huge wall, covered in clocks. Each clock has only one hand, and each hand has a name written on it. Some clocks are moving rather slowly, while others go a full circle in less than ten seconds. The man asks one of the angels there about the strange wall. The angel responds:Each clock in this room represents a country back on Earth. You see, each clock has the country's name written on the hand, and each time a person from that country commits a sinful act, the hand on said clock goes forward a bit. The bigger the country the bigger the clock.Intrigued by this, the man seeks out the clock of his own country, Canada. And what do you know, there it is, going forward one step at a time. He looks at all the other clocks, like Russia, the biggest if them all. Right next to Russia is tiny Estonia, and next to that Finland, Sweden and Norway, all going steadily forward, almost simultaneously.But one clock is missing. The man asks the angel, Where is the American clock? I thought it would be pretty big, but I can't see it anywhere.The angel responds:Ah yes, that one. An arrangement was made to have that one transferred to hell.The man asks:Huh? Why is that?	To which the angel responds:It's being used as the ceiling fan in the smoking room.

Once upon a time in an old magical kingdom, there lived an young monk called Sam... His order was renowned for their beautiful choralsinging. They trained, hours every day, refiningtheir voices and their art. Their song floateddown the mountainside, enriching the lives andsouls of the townspeople belowSam was particularly gifted, and on his 19thbirthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifullyintricate note of pure magic. Everyone withinmiles just froze in mid action, stirred to the verycore of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.And all the realm realized, instantly, that it wasSam, and Sam was the first person in historyto hit one of the rumored Magical Notes thatmusicians had theorized must exist... yet no onebefore Sam had ever reached one.And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.This time, the town below was so impactedthat no one moved, spoke, or even blink forseveral minutes after. As the golden sound finallytapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam hadfound the Second Note...And the next year on Sam's birthday, the townhad realized there was a pattern involved. Thistime, all of the townspeople were present in themonastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hitthe glorious Third Note. People cried out in purepurejoy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.Words cannot do justice to the experience.

Walking through the forest, an atheist hears a rustling in the bushes. Turning, he sees a massive grizzly charging towards him! He runs as fast as he can but trips over a stump and falls.

It would be hypocritical to ask you to show mercy on me, the atheist agrees. But perhaps you could make the bear a Christian?

And finally, we have a girl up stairs who's never slept with a man, and you gotta go make things right with her. Laughing, the man exclaims, Well that sounds like the stupidest test I've ever heard of! He leaves to get drunk with his friends. Later that night, the man comes back to the bartender absolutely hammered drunk. Ok bartender! Let's do this test! He says.The bartender hands him a gallon of pepper tequila, and before he could warn him, the man starts chugging it.

Three people die and appear before Buddha. Stunned by the divine presence before them, they lower their heads.-Raise your heads. You were humble in life and your deeds were praiseworthy. You have earned the right to a reincarnation of your choice. You have much to accomplish yet though.One of the people takes a step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled.-Benevolent Buddha, what more could I possibly do in my next life? I thought I lived and acted to the fullest. Because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve.-My work was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. Right now, the world I leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.-My connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.-I know all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that I ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation.The three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.-Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?-Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.-You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?-Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.-This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?-W-well, I don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.	(edit: obligatory editted thanks to the kind people who handed over silver & gold to my stupid joke

Ms. Brooks asks, What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?Harry, after a moment:  Legs.Ms. Brooks:  What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?The principal wondered why would she ask such a question!Harry replied:  Pockets. to the Principal’s great relief. Ms. Brooks:  What does a dog do that a man steps into?Harry:  Pants.By now, the principal is sitting forward with his mouth hanging open.Ms. Brooks:  What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?Now the principal's eyes open really wide and before he could intervene, Harry replied, Bubble gum.Ms. Brooks:  What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?Harry:  Shake hands.The principal is now trembling with apprehension as Ms. Brooks asks the last question.Ms.	Brooks:  What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' and indicates a great deal of heat and excitement?Harry: Firetruck.The principal breaths a huge sigh of relief and tells the teacher, Put the little bastard in 5th Grade; I got the last seven questions wrong myself.

This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?The first guy answers, That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye! The policeman says, Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile.Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?The second guy smiles, flips his hair, and says, Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!The policeman angrily responds, What's the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, This is your suspect, how would you recognize him? He quickly adds, Think hard before giving me a stupid answer.The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, the suspect wears contact lenses.The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not. Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that. He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?That's easy, the third guy replied.	He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear.

There's a little-known legend about Attila the Hun... The story goes that Attila used to collect exotic animals that he found during his conquests. He particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was a giant snake. He was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign.But his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet.Wishing to save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent.	Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.Curious, Attila did as he asked.Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.Now hold these in both hands, he instructed.Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.To an amazed Attila, the old man simply said,Thy anaconda don't want nun unless you've got buns, Hun.

A woman joins a country club and when she hears the guys talking about their golf round, she says, I played on my college's golf team. I was pretty good. Mind if I join you next week? No one wants to say 'yes', but they're on the spot.  Finally, one man says, Okay, but we start at 6:30 a.m.He figures the early tee-time will discourage her.The woman says this may be a problem and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late.They roll their eyes, but say, Okay.She's there at 6:30 am. sharp and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round.She's fun and pleasant and the guys are impressed.They congratulate her and invite her back the next week.She smiles, and says, I'll be there at 6:30, or 6:45.The next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp.Only this time, she plays left-handed.The three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand.They're totally amazed.They can't figure her out.She's very pleasant and a gracious winner.They invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.The third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys.This week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them.The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part.However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.This woman is a riddle no one can figure out.They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse and finally, one of the men asks her, How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?The lady blushes, and grins.

Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community... If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each otherThe Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.The Rabbi pulled out an apple.With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue! 'Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.	'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'

A gambler dies and goes to Heaven... A professional gambler wins big and dies of an aneurysm. When he gets to the afterlife, he finds himself at the back of a miles-long line to get into Heaven.Drawing on his experience, the gambler immediately thinks of a way to get ahead of everyone else. He taps the old man ahead of him on the shoulder...Want to make a bet while we wait? The Gambler asks. If I can guess your last words in three tries, you have to let me cut ahead of you.The old man, having nothing better to do, agrees. Immediately, the gambler begins reading him like the pro player he is. He notices the elderly Asian man's shirt is open, exposing a pair of defibrillator marks.Don't be silly, it's just indigestion. the gambler remarks. The old man looks a bit surprised, then steps aside, giving up his place in line.Next, the gambler taps on a redneck's shoulder. He makes the same bet, and the redneck also accepts.This one's easy! the gambler smirks, sizing up the bruised, bloody, grass stained redneck with the caved in skull. Hold my beer!Muttering profanities, the redneck begrudgingly steps aside and gives up his place in line.Riding the high of a hot streak, the gambler wastes no time tapping the next man ahead of him on the shoulder. He quickly makes the same bet, and is ecstatic when the agreement is made.Okay, let's see... The gambler studies the new mark carefully. He's a large, imposing black man riddled with several bullet holes.The gambler holds his hand out like a gun. You ain't taking me alive!The man shakes his head. Wrong. The gambler strokes his chin. The guy is giving him nothing else to work with.The gambler holds the 'gun' sideways, makes a mean face, and shouts, Fuck the police!Wrong again. The gambler's getting frustrated, now. He's never been unable to read someone before.Finally, the gambler throws his hands in the air. I'VE GOT NOTHING! He shouts.	I GIVE UP!The man steps aside.

An elderly woman walked into the Royal Bank of Ireland one morning with a purse full of money.  She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money. After many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office. The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'. The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money . The elderly woman replied that she made bets. The president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?' The elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.' The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that. The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?' 'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.' 'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.' 'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently. That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that way, up and down, turned it around, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet. The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square  The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly. The president was happy to oblige. The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.' The elderly woman did so with a little smile.	Suddenly the president noticed that the \*lawyer was banging his head against the wall.\*  He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, 'Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock this morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Royal Bank of Ireland '

An elderly woman walked into the Royal Bank of Ireland one morning with a purse full of money.  She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money. After many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office. The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'. The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money . The elderly woman replied that she made bets. The president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?' The elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.' The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that. The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?' 'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.' 'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.' 'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently. That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that way, up and down, turned it around, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet. The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square  The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly. The president was happy to oblige. The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.' The elderly woman did so with a little smile.	Suddenly the president noticed that the \*lawyer was banging his head against the wall.\*  He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, 'Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock this morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Royal Bank of Ireland '

Stoner Joke. Three Men Died and Went to Hell Where They Met the Devil. (Warning! Long one) Three men died and went to hell where they met the Devil. The Devil told them that they had sinned in life and therefore had to spend the next 666 years in hell to atone for their sins. However, since the Devil wasn't entirely merciless, he would let them choose for themselves how they were going to spend those 666 years. And so the Devil let the men to three doors.Going through the first door, they entered what looked to be a normal bar. Although, if you were there for more than an hour, you would notice that no matter how much you tried to drink another bottle would appear on the shelf. And even better, the bar always had the exact drink you wanted available. An unlimited supply of every alcoholic beverage in existence. It was, in short, a drunkard's paradise.When they entered the second door, they were greeted by a myriad of women all ready to satisfy every sexual desire they could possible have. There were multiple women of every shape, size and ethnicity imaginable. Looking closer you would notice that there were even celebrity and work crushes from your life in the crowd. Every single one of them ready  to please you. It was, in short, a pervert's paradiseFinally, when they entered the third door, they found themselves in a forest made of cannabis. The ground was made of kief, all the bushes wore beatiful buds and even the trees were 20 feet tall cannabis plants. There were every strain it has or ever will be possible to grow. You could even find rocks of hashish laying around the forest floor if you looked closely. It was, in short, a stoner's paradise.The Devil asked the men which room they each wanted. The words had barely left the Devil's mouth before the first man ran directly to the room with a myriad of women. The second man then went to the room with the bar, thinking that if he was going to spend 666 years in hell, he might as well be drunk for most of it. Lastly, the third man, thinking he had won the lottery, gladly went towards the room with the forest of cannabis.666 years later, the Devil returned to see if the men had atoned for their sins.When he opened the first door, bottles slowly rolled out and you could immediately smell piss and puke coming from the room. It took the Devil a while, but he finally found the man nestled between the bottles, smeared in his own shit and puke, and with arguably the worst hangover in history. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.When he opened the second door, he was overwhelmed with the sound of hundreds of crying children and angry women. Not ten seconds after the door opened, the man came running, pleading for the Devil to please let him out. There were kids of every age running around screaming and all the women were angry at each other, while everyone, children and mothers alike, were angry at the man. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.When the Devil opened the third door, he immediately saw the man sitting cross legged in a giant pool of his own tears. The Devil had not expected this. Confused, he went to ask the man what was wrong.	The man, tears still running down his face, looked up at the Devil and said:I don't have a lighter

A journalist asked Tim Cook why iPhones are so expensive. Well, said Tim Cook, that's because the iPhone replaces a whole bunch of devices.

Surely, a high price is worth paying to replace so many devices!Then why are Androids so much cheaper?, asked the journalist.Because, said Tim Cook, an Android replaces just one device.	The iPhone.
A Priest, a thief, a Jewish schoolboy and Irishman die in a car crash... They stand before Saint Peter at the gates of heaven. Saint Peter looks at them and appears confused. My children he says There has been a mistake, you were not supposed to die today. I will allow you one more chance at life as long as you promise to love out the rest of your existence free of sin. Eager to return to their lives the men all agree, and *POOF* they appear back on Earth. They stand awestruck, wondering if what they had just experienced was real or just a dream. The thief notices a woman walking with an expensive looking purse. Convinced that he had only imagined the gates of heaven he rushes and attempts to steal the purse and *POOF* he disappears. Realizing what just happened the others understand that they must truly live without sin. The Irishman looks to his left and sees a pub. One drink won't hurt he says as he orders a pint. He lifts the cup to his lips and *POOF* he disappears. The Jewish schoolboy looks down and sees a coin that fell from the vanishing Irishman's pocket.	He bends down to pick it up, fully aware that greed is a sin, and *POOF* the priest disappears.

Two Aliens. Two aliens landed in the Arizona desert near a gas station that was closed for the night. They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien addressed it saying, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.The gas pump, of course, didn't respond.The younger alien became angry at the lack of response.The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you. 'The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response. Pissed at  the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said gruffly, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader or I will fire!The older alien again warned his comrade saying,  'You probably don't want to do that! I really think that will make him mad. ''Rubbish,' replied the cocky, young alien. He aimed his weapon  and opened fire. There was a huge explosion. A massive fireball roared towards him and blew the younger alien off his feet and threw him in a burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch.Half an hour passed. When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head. 'What a ferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien. 'He damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?	'The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, 'If there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you never mess with a guy who can loop his pen!s over his shoulder twice and then stick it in his ear.'

Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community... If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each otherThe Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.The Rabbi pulled out an apple.With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue! 'Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.

After a pause, the instructor added, I gave you an extra 50% because you did it all through the muffler, which I’ve never seen done in my entire career.

His days continue as before, and his evenings are still spent in pleasant company, but a new addition to his routine is a nightly visit to the barrel.Another two months pass in this way and all is well, until one night as he gets up from his seat at the card table and announces that he is going to visit the barrel to his mates.A few chuckles greet this announcement and one of his friends asks Trying to get the final fun out of it eh?Final fun?

[Serious] Just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive. A few days ago I was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.Here's the joke I told:What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.Obviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown?No, replied the guy.	He choked on a sock.

Your DUCK IS DEAD. A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest.After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.The distressed woman wailed, Are you sure?Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead, replied the vet..How can you be so sure? she protested.. I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.The vet looked at the woman and said, I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. $1,500! she cried,$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!The vet shrugged, I'm sorry.	If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500.

An HR manager was knocked down (tragically) by a bus and was killed. Her soul arrived at the Pearly Gates, where St.Peter welcomed her. Before you get settled in he said, We have a little problem…you see, we’ve never had a HR manager make it this far before and we’re not really sure what to do with you.Oh, I see, said the woman, can’t you just let me in?Well, I’d like to, said St Peter, But I have higher orders. We’re instructed to let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you’d like to go for all eternity.Actually, I think I’d prefer heaven, said the woman. Sorry, we have rules… at which St. Peter put the HR manager into the downward bound elevator.As the doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times.They played a perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed a superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had a wonderful night telling jokes and dancing.Before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. Now it’s time to spend a day in heaven, he said.So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day’s end St. Peter returned. So, he said, You’ve spent a day in hell and you’ve spent a day in heaven. You must choose between the two.The woman thought for a second and replied: Well, heaven is certainly lovely, but I actually had a better time in hell. I choose Hell.Accordingly, St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her.I don’t understand, stuttered the HR manager, The other day I was here, and there was a golf course, and a country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had a wonderful happy time.	Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.The Devil simply looked at her and smiled, Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you’re staff.

Sales pitch. Bubba Joe's first military assignment was to a military induction center, and, because he was a good talker, they assigned him the duty of advising new recruits about the government benefits, especially the GI insurance to which they were entitled.Before long the Captain in charge of the induction center began noticing that Bubba was getting a 99 percent sign-up for the top GI insurance.This was odd, because it would cost these poor inductees nearly $30.00 per month more for their higher coverage than what the government was already granting.The Captain decided that he would sit in the back of the room and observe Bubba's sales pitch. Bubba Joe stood up before his latest group of inductees and stated, If you have the normal GI insurance and go to Iraq and are killed, the government pays your beneficiary $6,000. If you take out the supplemental GI insurance, which will cost you an additional $30.00 per month, the government pays your beneficiary $200,000.	Now, Bubba concluded, which bunch do you think they're gonna send into combat first?

A guy walks into a bar, followed by an ostrich, followed by a cat. All three sit down at the bar. The bartender looks at the man and says, What’ll ya have? The man says, Gimme a beer. The ostrich says, I’ll have one too. The cat says, I want two beers, but I’m only gonna pay half price. The bartender serves up four beers, and tells the man, that’ll be $12.67. The man reaches in his pocket and without even looking sets exact change down on the bar. After they finish their beers, the bartender asks, anything else? The man says, Gimme a shot of bourbon. The ostrich says, I’ll have one too. The cat says, I want a double bourbon, but I’m only gonna pay half price. The bartender serves them and says, That’s $14.03. The man reaches into his pocket and without even looking again sets exact change on the bar. After that round, the bartender says, What else will ya have? The man says, I need a Jack and Coke.

Most people would wish for a million or five million or whatever. This way, you’ll never run out of money, you don’t have to worry about carrying it, and you’ll never be robbed! Absolutely brilliant.The man says, I know, and thank you!The bartender says, So what did you ask for with your other two wishes?	The man said A chick with long legs and a tight pussy.

An easy question to Albert Einstein! One day, Einstein has to speak at an important science conference.On the way there, he tells his driver that looks a bit like him: I'm sick of all these conferences. I always say the same things over and over!The driver agrees: You're right. As your driver, I attended all of them, and even though I don't know anything about science, I could give the conference in your place. That's a great idea! says Einstein. Let's switch places then! So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it. But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.	The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says : Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.
A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?  The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.The man says, All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door.The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, Real funny.	May I have the key?The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.The man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk

Jesus and Moses are golfing in a threesome. Moses tees off first and uncorks a high sailing slice. The ball plops into the middle of a lake. Unperturbed, Moses walks to the edge of the lake, raises his club, and the waters part. Moses chips onto the green. Jesus tees off next.

As the prayer finishes, he drops to his knees and swings his fist into the naked guys balls, flooring him! The naked guy slowly comes to his senses and crawls out of the mosque.Confused, the marine asks the mosque leader what's going on... These men are thieves, rapists and murderers from all over Afghanistan. He says, Instead of prison, their punishment is to walk through the desert in nothing but their sandals, receive Allah's justice, then return home.The marine returns to his post and continues to watch these unusual punishments.After 6 long months of no bed, no clean water, no toilet and witnessing this unusual justice system, his replacement arrives.Hey, my last post was in Korea, how is it here?

A married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine that would transfer a portion of the mother's labor pain to the father. He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it.The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine.The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him. The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain.	She and her husband were ecstatic.When they got home, the mailman was dead on the porch.

Walking through the forest, an atheist hears a rustling in the bushes. Turning, he sees a massive grizzly charging towards him! He runs as fast as he can but trips over a stump and falls. As the bear raises a huge paw to strike, the atheist screams: God! Help me!Time freezes. The bear becomes immobile, the forest is silent, and the river stops running. Then the atheist hears a powerful voice: You have denied my existence for years, taught others I don’t exist and credited my creation to a cosmic accident. Why should I help you? It would be hypocritical to ask you to show mercy on me, the atheist agrees. But perhaps you could make the bear a Christian?	At that, the noise of the forest resumes, the river runs, and the bear drops to its knees, brings its paws together, and says, Lord, for this food which I am about to receive, I am truly thankful.

You don't suppose she took it, do you?He said ,Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just to be sure.He sat down and wrote :Dear Mother:I'm not saying that you ‘did' take the silver plate from my house, I'm not saying that you ‘did not' take the silver plate .. But the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.Love,your sonSeveral days later, he received an email from his Mother which read:Dear Son:I'm not saying that you ‘do' sleep with your roommate, and I'm not saying that you ‘do not' sleep with her.	But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her OWN bed, she would have found the silver plate by now, under the pillow…Love,Mom.﻿

In a crowded city at a bus stop, a beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in a tight leather mini skirt, with matching tight leather boots and jacket... As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus. Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't! So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. With a coy little smile to the driver, she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step.About this time, a big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, How dare you touch my body!!	I don't even know who you are!At this, the Texan drawled, Well ma'am normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends.

Once upon a time there lived a beautiful Queen with large breasts. Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.The moral of the story - Pay your bills !	!

Two rednecks flew to Canada on a hunting trip.    They chartered a small plane to take them into the Rockies for a week hunting moose. They managed to bag 6. As they were loading the plane to return, the Pilot said the plane could take only 4 moose. The two guys objected strongly. Last year we shot six. The pilot let us take them all and he had the same plane as yours. Reluctantly, the pilot gave in and all six were loaded. The plane took  off.

So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living. He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said, Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just a bad conductor.

A man walks into a bar and asks the bartender,   If I show you a really good trick, will you give me a free drink? The bartender considers it, then agrees. The man reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tiny rat. He reaches into his other pocket and pulls out a tiny piano. The rat stretches, cracks his knuckles, and proceeds to play the blues. The bartender pours the man a drink on the house and he puts the rat and piano away. After the man finished his drink, he asked the bartender, If I show you an even better trick, will you give me free drinks for the rest of the evening? The bartender agrees, thinking that no trick could possibly be better than the first. The man reaches into his pockets again and pulls out the tiny rat and tiny piano. The rat stretches, cracks his knuckles, and proceeds to play the blues. The man reaches into a third pocket and pulls out a small bullfrog, who begins to sing along with the rat's music. While the man is enjoying his beverages, a stranger confronts him and offers him $100,000.00 for the bullfrog. Sorry, the man replies, he's not for sale. The stranger increases the offer to $250,000.00 cash up front. No, he insists, he's not for sale. The stranger again increases the offer, this time to $500,000.00 cash. The man finally agrees, and turns the frog over to the stranger in exchange for the money. Are you insane? the bartender demanded. That frog could have been worth millions to you, and you let him go for a mere $500,000! Don't worry about it, the man answered. The frog was nothing special.	You see, the rat's a ventriloquist.

A new twist on an old joke. Scientists recently did a study on the effects the right side and left side of a brain had on counting.They first took out the left half of a man's brain and asked him to count to 10. He says, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.They put the left half back in and removed the right half, asking him to count to 10 again. He says 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.Finally they decided to just go for it and removed the whole brain. They again asked him to count to 10 one more time.He says, Look. I'm great at counting to 10, ok? I love numbers and I have the best numbers. No one has better numbers than I do. My 4th grade math teacher - and let me tell you, she was the best and smartest math teacher in the country at the time - my 4th grade math teacher said to me that I am the best counter she's ever seen. The best. So if you want me to count to 10, let me tell you I can count to 10 alright. That's no problem. I will do it. I will.	And I will do it better than any has ever done it before, ok?
Man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.You're in the afterlife! he tells the man, But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.What are the odds? they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line. The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. Come, the beggar told him, I'll take you to the evening meal. So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line, and then he added, and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. What is it, he thought, that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here? That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.The beggar laughed jovially. I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in! Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. That's the line for the dragon meat, he said before turning to the next line, and that's the line for angeldust stew, then he paused, confused.What is it?	the man asked his old friend.The beggar replied, There appears to be no punchline.

Sex with ghosts. A professor at Wayne State University in Detroit was giving a lecture on Paranormal Studies. To get a feel for his audience, he asks, How many people here believe in ghosts? About 90 students raise their hands. Well, that's a good start. Out of those who believe in ghosts, do any of you think you have seen a ghost?About 40 students raise their hands.That's really good. I'm really glad you take this seriously. Has anyone here ever talked to a ghost?About 15 students raise their hand.Has anyone here ever touched a ghost?Three students raise their hands.That's fantastic. Now let me ask you one question further...Have any of you ever made love to a ghost?Way in the back, Hamid raises his hand.The professor takes off his glasses and says, Son, all the years I've been giving this lecture, no one has ever claimed to have made love to a ghost You've got to come up here and tell us about your experience.The Middle Eastern student replied with a nod and a grin, and began to make his way up to the podium.

Surely, a high price is worth paying to replace so many devices!Then why are Androids so much cheaper?, asked the journalist.Because, said Tim Cook, an Android replaces just one device.	The iPhone.

Your DUCK IS DEAD. A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest.After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.The distressed woman wailed, Are you sure?Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead, replied the vet..How can you be so sure? she protested.. I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.The vet looked at the woman and said, I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. $1,500! she cried,$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!The vet shrugged, I'm sorry.	If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500.
I’m sure my wife won’t like this. While riding my motorbike, I swerved to avoid hitting a deer, lost control and landed in a ditch, severely banging my head.Dazed and confused I crawled out of the ditch to the edge of the road when a shiny new convertible pulled up with a very beautiful woman who asked, Are you okay?As I looked up, I noticed she was wearing a low-cut blouse with cleavage to die for...I'm okay I think, I replied as I pulled myself up to the side of the car to get a closer look.She said, Get in and I’ll take you home, so I can clean and bandage that nasty scrape on your head.That's nice of you, I answered, but I don't think my wife will like me doing that!Oh, come now, I’m a nurse, she insisted. I need to see if you have any more scrapes and then treat them properly.Well, she was pretty and very persuasive. Being sort of shaken and weak, I agreed, but repeated, I'm sure my wife won't like this.We arrived at her place which was just few miles away and, after a couple of cold beers and the bandaging, I thanked her and said, I feel a lot better, but I know my wife is going to be really upset so I'd better go now.Don't be silly! she said with a smile. Stay for a while. She won't know anything.	By the way, where is she?Still in the ditch with the motorbike, I guess.

We come in peace. Take us to your leader or I will fire!The older alien again warned his comrade saying,  'You probably don't want to do that! I really think that will make him mad.

Your DUCK IS DEAD. A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest.After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.The distressed woman wailed, Are you sure?Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead, replied the vet..How can you be so sure? she protested.. I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.The vet looked at the woman and said, I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. $1,500! she cried,$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!The vet shrugged, I'm sorry.	If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500.

There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living... There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.The man was perfectly fine.Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just a bad conductor.

The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train, looking for an empty seat. The only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged lady and was being used by her little dog.The war weary soldier asked, Please, ma'am, may I sit in that seat? The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see my Little Fifi is using that seat? The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing the woman with the dog.Again he asked, Please, lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired. The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant.The soldier didnt say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.The woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing.

An elderly woman walked into the Royal Bank of Ireland one morning with a purse full of money.  She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money. After many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office. The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'. The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money . The elderly woman replied that she made bets. The president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?' The elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.' The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that. The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?' 'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.' 'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.' 'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently. That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that way, up and down, turned it around, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet. The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square  The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly. The president was happy to oblige. The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.' The elderly woman did so with a little smile.	Suddenly the president noticed that the \*lawyer was banging his head against the wall.\*  He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, 'Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock this morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Royal Bank of Ireland '

What a team is?The little boy nodded in the affirmative.Do you understand that what matters is not whether we win or lose, but how we play together as a team?The little boy nodded yes.So, the coach continued, I'm sure you know, when a penalty is called, you shouldn't argue, curse, attack the referee, or call him a pecker-head.Do you understand all that?Again the little boy nodded.He continued, And when I call you off the ice so that another boy gets a chance to play, it's not good sportsmanship to call your coach 'adumb a--hole', is it?Again the little boy nodded.Good, said the coach.	Now go over there and explain all that to your mother.

A pensioner drove his brand new Mercedes Benz to 100 mph. Looking in his rear view mirror, he sees a cop behind him, signaling to pull over. He floored it to 140 , then 150, then 155, and 160…Suddenly he thought, Shit man, I'm too old for this nonsense! So he pulled over to the side of the road and waited for the cop to catch up with him. The officer walked up to him, looked at his watch and said, Sir, my shift ends in ten minutes. And guess what, today is Friday and I'm taking off for the weekend with my family to the beach. If you can give me a good, solid reason for your insane speeding that I've never heard before, I promise you that I will let you go.

A man goes to heaven, and to his surprise, he sees a huge wall covered in clocks. A man goes to heaven, and after walking through the gates, he gets escorted to a waiting room. In the room, he sees a huge wall, covered in clocks. Each clock has only one hand, and each hand has a name written on it. Some clocks are moving rather slowly, while others go a full circle in less than ten seconds. The man asks one of the angels there about the strange wall. The angel responds:Each clock in this room represents a country back on Earth. You see, each clock has the country's name written on the hand, and each time a person from that country commits a sinful act, the hand on said clock goes forward a bit. The bigger the country the bigger the clock.Intrigued by this, the man seeks out the clock of his own country, Canada. And what do you know, there it is, going forward one step at a time. He looks at all the other clocks, like Russia, the biggest if them all. Right next to Russia is tiny Estonia, and next to that Finland, Sweden and Norway, all going steadily forward, almost simultaneously.But one clock is missing. The man asks the angel, Where is the American clock? I thought it would be pretty big, but I can't see it anywhere.The angel responds:Ah yes, that one. An arrangement was made to have that one transferred to hell.The man asks:Huh? Why is that?	To which the angel responds:It's being used as the ceiling fan in the smoking room.

Three girls all worked in the same office with the same female boss. Each day, they noticed the boss left work early. One day, the girls decided that, when the boss left, they would leave right behind her. After all, she never called or came back to work, so how would she know if they went home early? The brunette was thrilled to be home early. She did a little gardening, spent playtime with her son, and went to bed early. The redhead was elated to be able to get in a quick workout at the spa before meeting a dinner date. The blonde was happy to get home early and surprise her husband, but when she got to her bedroom, she heard a muffled noise from inside. Slowly and quietly, she cracked open the door and was mortified to see her husband in bed with her boss! Gently she closed the door and crept out of her house. The next day, at their coffee break,the brunette and redhead planned to leave early again,and they asked the blonde if she was going to go with them. No way, the blonde exclaimed.	I almost got caught yesterday.
A little girl was playing in the garden. A father watched his young daughter as she played in the garden.

So, the other one is a Mommy Longlegs? she asked.The father's heart soared with the joy of such a cute and innocent question. He laughed, and then replied, No sweetheart. Both of them are Daddy Longlegs.The little girl, looking a little puzzled, thought for a moment, then lifted her foot and stomped the spiders flat.	Well, we’re not having any of that gay shit in our garden.

A fancy restaurant is hiring a new pianist. A guy called John comes in and says Hi there, I'm here about the pianist position. The manager replies That's fantastic, do you mind sitting at the piano and showing me what you can do?So John sits at the piano and starts to play one of the most beautiful songs the manager has ever heard. Stunned at the end of the performance he says That's absolutely wonderful, what's it called?John replies Oh it's one of my songs, I call it 'Your daughter sucked on my balls and I jizzed on her forehead'.The manager, shocked, stammers Oh, right... urr, do you have any more? The pianist resumes playing, and yet again plays an absolutely magical piece of music. The manager says Incredible! What do you call this one?John replies Oh, I call that one 'I'm going to stick my tongue up your asshole and lick your colon'.The manager says to him Ok, look, you're hired. I can't let a talent like you get away, but please never let the clients know the names of your songs, it simply won't do in an establishment like this.So John agrees and starts work that night.A few weeks later, the buzz about the restaurant is incredible, people are so enamored with this pianist they recommend their friends, come back regularly just to eat and hear this amazing music play. And one night, the pianist says to the diners OK ladies and gentlemen, after this song I'm going to take a short break and I'll resume my playing for you shortly, and goes off to take a small comfort break.As he's returning from the restroom the manager swiftly approaches him and exclaims John! Do you know your dick is hanging out of your trousers and the whole room can see it? !John replies Know it?!	I fucking wrote it!

There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living... There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.The man was perfectly fine.Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just a bad conductor.

The lion abruptly stops and says  woah! This guy seems tougher then he looks, I better leave while I can. Over by the tree top, a monkey witnessed everything. Evidently, the monkey realizes the he can benefit from this situation by telling the lion and getting something in return. So the monkey proceeds to tell the lion what really happened and the lion says angrily get on my back, we'll get him together. So they start rushing back to the dog. The dog sees them and realized what happened and starts to panic even more. He then gets another idea and shouts where the hell is that monkey!	I told him to bring me another lion an hour ago...
4 years ago today, I shared the worst joke I ever created. Here it is again for those that missed it. There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted. About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off. The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak. The grim reaper swears. Oh no! This always happens with identical twins. What do you mean? asks the dentist. Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now. The dentist is noticeably upset. He says Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life. The grim reaper asks What do you have in mind? The dentist thinks. How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free. The grim reaper laughs. I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose? The dentist smiles. I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide. Very well says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom. Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance. The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles. It's unbelievable. The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth. The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. You win, human. This time. Your brother will live. He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died. The dentist smiles on the phone and says. That's interesting, bro.	Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.

Uh, yes, officer?The cop says: What are you doing?The young man says: Well Officer, I’m reading a magazine.Pointing towards the young woman in the back seat the cop says: And her, what is she doing?The young man shrugs: Sir, I believe she’s knitting a pullover sweater.Now, the cop is totally confused..

How dare you use that kind of language around a Pastors wife!The guy behind the counter calms her down and says. No, no ma’am. This is a new breed of fish that live down at the local roller dam. So we call it Dam fish.The pastors wife understands, buys 3 fillets, and heads home to start cooking. As she’s cooking the pastor comes home and says.Something smells delicious hunny! What are ya cooking! ?The wife says. Dam Fish.The pastor freaks out and says. I cannot believe I’m hearing profanity out of a pastors wife!

One day in the future, Donald Trump has a heart-attack and dies. He immediately goes to Hell, where the devil is waiting for him. I don't know what to do here, says the devil.You are on my list, but I have no room for you. You definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I've got three folks here who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU decide who leaves.Donald thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room.In it, was Richard Nixon and a  large pool of water. Nixon kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed. Over, and over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. Such was his fate in  hell.No, Donald said. I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and it would ruin my hair. I don't think I could do that all day  long.The devil led him to the door of the next room. In it, was Ronald Reagan with a sledge-hammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that  hammer, time after time after time. No, this is no good; I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day, commented Donald.The devil opened a third door. Through it, Donald saw Bill Clinton, lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head, and his legs restrained in a spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.	Donald looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said, Yeah man, I can handle this.The devil smiled and said, Okay: Monica, you're free to go.

A blonde, wanting to earn some money, decided to hire herself out as a odd-job man and started with a wealthy neighborhood. She went to the front door of the first house and asked the owner if he had any jobs for her to do.Well, you can paint my porch. How much will you charge?The blonde said, How about 50 dollars? The man agreed and told her that the paint and ladders that she might need were in the garage. The man's wife, inside the house, heard the conversation and said to her husband, Does she realize that the porch goes all the way around the house?The man replied, She should. She was standing on the porch.A short time later, the blonde came to the door to collect her money. You're finished already? he asked.Yes, the blonde answered, and I had paint left over, so I gave it two coats. Impressed, the man reached in his pocket for the $50.	And by the way, the blonde added, that's not a Porch, it's a Ferrari.

A perfectly triangular lake has 3 kingdoms on its 3 sides. . The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.	And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.
Your DUCK IS DEAD. A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest.After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.The distressed woman wailed, Are you sure?Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead, replied the vet..How can you be so sure? she protested.. I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.The vet looked at the woman and said, I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. $1,500! she cried,$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!The vet shrugged, I'm sorry.	If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500.

Grandpa - why don't you have life insurance? Asks the grandson.	Grandpa laughs and says: I want you guys to be really sad when I die.
My grandfather died and I inherited some of his clothes. He was a farmer and he loved getting dressed up every year for the local fair and exhibiting his prize chickens. For this occasion, my grandmother would spend the entire year searching through thrift shops looking for silly neckties for him to wear, and she loved finding ones with chickens on them.After a few decades of this, my grandfather had amassed several dozen neckties, each one with cartoonish images of chickens flying around, laying eggs, and doing other chicken things. I always complimented him on the newest addition to his collection.When he died a couple of years ago, he bequeathed them to me in his will. When my grandmother handed me the bag full of them, my eyes welled with tears and I smiled thinking about my grandfather looking in the mirror and straightening his tie.Why am I telling you all of this back story?	Because the last time I tried to tell this to someone and I didn't give context, they thought it was weird that I was so excited about inheriting my dead grandfather's hen tie collection.

There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living... There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.The man was perfectly fine.Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just a bad conductor.

This time she thrashed about wildly and there were screams of passion.It finally ended and, again, Guido smiled and asked, You finish?Again, after a short pause, she returned his smile, cuddled closer to him and softly said, No.Stunned, but damned if he was going to leave this woman unsatisfied, Guido reached for the woman yet again.Using the last of his strength, he barely managed it, but they ended together screaming, bucking, clawing and ripping the bed sheets.Exhausted, Guido fell onto his back, gasping. Barely able to turn his head, he looked into her eyes, smiled proudly and asked again, You finish?	?Barely able to speak, the beautiful blonde whispered in his ear… No, I Norwegian.

A guy walks into a restaurant with a full-grown ostrich behind him.  The waitress asks for their orders. The guy says, A hamburger, fries, and a coke, and turns to the ostrich, What's yours?I'll have the same, says the ostrich.A short time later the waitress returns with the order. That will be $18.40 please. The man reaches into his pocket and, without looking, pulls out the exact change for payment.The next day, the guy and the ostrich come again and the guy says, A hamburger, fries, and a coke.The ostrich says, I'll have the same.Again the guy reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. This becomes routine until one night they enter the restaurant and the waitress asks, The usual?No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato, and salad, says the guy.Me too, says the ostrich.The waitress brings the order and says, That will be $42.62.Once again the guy pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. The waitress can't hold back her curiosity any longer. Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?Well, says the guy, several years ago I was cleaning my attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it a genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.That's brilliant! says the waitress. Most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!That's right.	Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there, says the guy.The waitress asks, But, sir, what's with the ostrich?The guy sighs and answers, My second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who agrees with everything I say.

All the things in the whole world and you wish for this?? Ok whatever, here you go.Hammer turns into stick.Man: Now I wish that you put that stick up your arse.God: (*furiously*) What?!!

Donald Trump was visiting a primary school and he visited one of the classes. They were in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings. The teacher asked the President if he would like to lead the discussion on the word tragedy. So the illustrious leader asked the class for an example of a tragedy. One little boy stood up and offered: If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs over him and kills him, that would be a tragedy. No, said Trump, that would be an accident A little girl raised her hand: If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy. I’m afraid not, explained the president. That’s what we would call great loss. The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Trump searched the room. Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? Finally at the back of the room a small boy raised his hand... In a quiet voice he said: If ‘Air Force One’ was carrying you and was struck by a friendly fire missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy. Fantastic! exclaimed Trump. That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be tragedy?	Well, said the boy, It has to be a tragedy, because it certainly wouldn’t be a great loss, and it probably wouldn’t be a fucking accident either.

You’re not a monk.The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.The man says, All right, all right. I’m dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 pebbles on the earth.The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door.The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, Real funny.	May I have the key?The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.The man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.

Well, said the Englishman, At my local in London , the barman will buy you your third drink after you buy the first two. Ahhh, dat's nothin', said the Irishman, back home in my favorite pub, the moment you set foot in the place, they'll buy you a drink, then another, all the drinksyou like, actually. Then, when you've had enough drinks, they'll take you upstairs and see that you gets laid, all on the house! The Englishman and Scotsman were suspicious of the claims.

A married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine that would transfer a portion of the mother's labor pain to the father. He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it.The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine.The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%.

The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain.	She and her husband were ecstatic.When they got home, the mailman was dead on the porch.

A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night? The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.The man says, All right, all right. I’m dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 pebbles on the earth.The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door.The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, Real funny.	May I have the key?The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.The man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.

Three men, Joe, Bro, and Buddy, all lived in a small town. One day, Joe went hunting alone, and for the next few days no one heard from him. About a week afterwards, a body was found and brought into the coroner’s office. The coroner, after thoroughly examining the body, needed a positive identification in order to verify that the body was indeed Joe. So, he brought in Bro and Buddy, and told them to come in separately to identify the body. Bro came in first, and was asked to look for any details about the body that he recognized. After a few minutes of examining, Bro said, Mr. Coroner, I’ll need you to turn the body over for me to be sure.Confused, the coroner obliged. Bro continued to examine the body, bent down on one knee, reared his head sideways, then stood up and said, No sir, this can’t be Joe.The coroner was even more confused, but he accepted this statement and sent Bro out. Next, he invited Buddy in to repeat the task. Buddy, after examining the body in a similar fashion to Bro, also requested that the body be turned over.The coroner, after mumbling a bit about his confusion, flipped the body over. Buddy too bent down on one knee and examined the back area of the body, then, just as Bro had previously, said, No sir, Mr. Coroner, this isn’t Joe.The coroner was astonished, so he asked that Bro come back in so that the two of them were standing there at once. The coroner said, Gentlemen, this man’s dental records and features match perfectly with those of your friend Joe’s. How on earth are you both positive this isn’t him?Bro and Buddy looked at each other, then Bro answered, Sir, this can’t be Joe because Joe has two assholes.In shock, the coroner asked, How can he have two assholes? Have you ever seen them?Buddy replied, No sir, but it was common knowledge. Every time we were out with him, people would say, ‘Look, it’s Joe with those two assholes!’**Credit goes to my grandmother, who was the first to tell me this joke.	**

A husband notices his wife’s hearing is deteriorating and decides to visit her doctor for advice. I can’t speak to my wife directly as she might find it offensive, given our old age he says to the doc. There’s a simple trick you can try to determine her hearing explains the doctor. Simply ask her a question at a distance and if she doesn’t hear you, move slightly closer and ask again until she does. That night, the husband arrives home and sees his wife in the kitchen cooking. He thinks to himself, what a perfect opportunity to test her hearing. He stands in the doorway of the kitchen and promptly asks;What’s for dinner honey?No answer. He moves closer.

A Priest, a thief, a Jewish schoolboy and Irishman die in a car crash... They stand before Saint Peter at the gates of heaven. Saint Peter looks at them and appears confused. My children he says There has been a mistake, you were not supposed to die today. I will allow you one more chance at life as long as you promise to love out the rest of your existence free of sin. Eager to return to their lives the men all agree, and *POOF* they appear back on Earth. They stand awestruck, wondering if what they had just experienced was real or just a dream. The thief notices a woman walking with an expensive looking purse. Convinced that he had only imagined the gates of heaven he rushes and attempts to steal the purse and *POOF* he disappears. Realizing what just happened the others understand that they must truly live without sin. The Irishman looks to his left and sees a pub. One drink won't hurt he says as he orders a pint. He lifts the cup to his lips and *POOF* he disappears. The Jewish schoolboy looks down and sees a coin that fell from the vanishing Irishman's pocket.	He bends down to pick it up, fully aware that greed is a sin, and *POOF* the priest disappears.

A politician dies. Instead of going straight to heaven or hell, a spirit appears to him. The spirit tells him that, rather than being judged for his sins, he gets to choose whether he goes to heaven or hell. The politician replies that of course he wants to go to heaven. The spirit tells him that before he chooses, he has to visit both places so each one will get a fair chance.First they visit heaven. It looks pretty nice. Big fluffy clouds, angels singing and playing harps, everyone seeming to enjoy themselves. The politician is pleased, if a bit underwhelmed.Hell, on the other hand, is magnificent. It’s the most beautiful place the politician has ever seen, and everyone there is having the time of their lives. It has a buffet table filled with delicious-smelling food, a beautiful garden, a pool with a water slide, a dance floor, a massage parlor, and innumerable other attractions. It makes heaven look dull and boring and comparison.I can’t believe I’m saying this, says the politician, but I think I’d rather go to hell! Very well, says the spirit. Turn around.When the politician turns around, though, hell appears to be completely different than it had been less than a minute ago. All of the attractions are gone, everything is on fire, and the people are screaming in agony.I don’t understand! cries the politician. This isn’t what you showed me before!Well, that was the campaign, replies the spirit.	Now you’ve voted.

Five friends were sitting around, debating which Pixar movie is the greatest. After a few hours of debate, no one was willing to concede, and it was decided that a vote must be held. Unfortunately, with so few friends present, it was clear that they would need to bring the vote to the greater public. The group decided that each friend would make a plea to the subreddit of their choice, and whoever received the most karma for it would win.Adam, already undecided himself, decided to go to /r/AskReddit. He laid out the agreement, and asked that everyone vote one their favorite movie, and the one with the most votes he would use for the his friends. Unfortunately, as the votes were split in that sub, his highest post amounted to a mere 38 points.Paul, a big proponent for the Toy Story franchise, posted to /r/nostalgia in the hopes that everyone who grew up with Toy Story would agree. Unfortunately, as there had been two sequels (with a third on the way) it wasn't exactly considered nostalgia and he got downvoted into oblivion.Bill, who loved Monsters Inc., made his case using some trickery. Going to /r/news, he found a seemingly unrelated post, and made a top-level comment describing, in great detail, why Monsters Inc. was the greatest film of all time. The fact that the post was so out of context made everyone flock to it, and drew enough attention to new him over a thousand fake internet points.Mike, who loved the Incredibles movies, decided to stay in his wheelhouse. Over the course of several hours, he created each of the family members from the Incredibles in Soulcaliber VI. Finally, he photoshopped the family together, and posted it to /r/gaming. Under normal circumstances this would have skyrocketed to the top, but the format was stale, and thus only received 20k karma. Still, Mike was confident in his victory.While the other four friends came up with plans on how to maximize their karma gains, Chris sat silently. For hours he sat, making no posts, coming up with no original content. Finally, an hour before the deadline, he broke into his neighbor's house, stealing his copy of the Pixar movie Up. He took a picture of his theft and posted it directly to /r/Jokes with the title STOLEN.When the group got together the next day to see who got the most votes, everyone was in awe. Chris's post had over 40,000 points. How did you know that would win? Easy, Chris replied.	Everyone knows stolen content on /r/Jokes gets all the Up votes.

Two Aliens. Two aliens landed in the Arizona desert near a gas station that was closed for the night. They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien addressed it saying, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.The gas pump, of course, didn't respond.The younger alien became angry at the lack of response.The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you. 'The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response. Pissed at  the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said gruffly, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader or I will fire!The older alien again warned his comrade saying,  'You probably don't want to do that! I really think that will make him mad. ''Rubbish,' replied the cocky, young alien. He aimed his weapon  and opened fire. There was a huge explosion. A massive fireball roared towards him and blew the younger alien off his feet and threw him in a burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch.Half an hour passed. When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head. 'What a ferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien. 'He damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?	'The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, 'If there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you never mess with a guy who can loop his pen!s over his shoulder twice and then stick it in his ear.'

Two Americans are touring Europe, and are scheduled to arrive in France Sunday afternoon. Two American men are touring Europe, and are scheduled to arrive in France Sunday afternoon. However, they arrived several hours early, and had little to do on Sunday morning while everything was closed.Well, one says to the other, pointing to a nearby Cathedral, why don't we attend Mass?Sure, replies his friend. But we don't know how the French pray and we can't speak French!The first guy thinks of a solution. We'll pick a guy in front of us, and whatever he does, we'll do.His friend agrees. They enter the church, sit close to the front, and choose a guy.Fifteen minutes pass, and their plan is working well. Thirty minutes, no issues.By the time forty-five minutes pass, they've gotten used to the routine. Suddenly, while everyone is seated, the priest says something in French and the gentleman they chose stands up. Without thinking, the two Americans stand up as well.The church bursts into hard laughter.Realizing that no one else is standing up, the two American men leave in embarrassment. They wait for the Mass to end, and then approach the priest, who spoke English.We're well-meaning people- we don't speak French and just chose some guy to imitate while praying, one says.The priest chuckles. Ah.	You're probably wondering why everyone laughed at you.Yes, replied the other American.Well, you see, I announced the Baptism of a child... and asked for the father of the child to stand up.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Edited to add: **thank you** to the kind stranger who gave me my first silver!

I grabbed the fridge and threw it at him.It was very heavy...That is how I strained my back. !Later that day, a second patient arrives as if he has been in a car wreck.The doctor said: My previous patient looked bad..But you look terrible..What the hell happened to you ?He replied: You know I have been unemployed for a while now.Today was the first day at my new job...I forgot to set my alarm and I was late...I was running out of the building, getting dressed at the same time.And you won't believe it but I was hit by a fridge.I don't know how and where from this fridge fell on me...!! !Before closing hours, the third patient comes.

A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night? The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.The man says, All right, all right. I’m dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 pebbles on the earth.The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door.The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, Real funny.	May I have the key?The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.The man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.

Putting it in. A married Irishman went into the confessional and said to his priest,'I almost had an affair with another woman. 'The priest said, 'What do you mean, almost? 'The Irishman said, 'Well, we got undressed and rubbed together, but then I stopped. 'The priest said, 'Rubbing together is the same as putting it in. You're not to see that woman again. For your penance, say five Hail Mary's and put $50 in the poor box. 'The Irishman left the confessional, said his prayers, and then walked over to the poor box.He paused for a moment and then started to leave.The priest, who was watching, quickly ran over to him saying, 'I saw that. You didn't put any money in the poor box!	'The Irishman replied, 'Yeah, but I rubbed the $50 on the box, andaccording to you, that's the same as putting it in!'

Three people die and appear before Buddha. Stunned by the divine presence before them, they lower their heads.-Raise your heads. You were humble in life and your deeds were praiseworthy. You have earned the right to a reincarnation of your choice. You have much to accomplish yet though.One of the people takes a step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled.-Benevolent Buddha, what more could I possibly do in my next life? I thought I lived and acted to the fullest. Because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve.-My work was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. Right now, the world I leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.-My connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.-I know all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that I ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation.The three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.-Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?-Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.-You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?-Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.-This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?-W-well, I don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.	(edit: obligatory editted thanks to the kind people who handed over silver & gold to my stupid joke

I was done in two minutes!She looked at me concerned and asked, Did you put the condom on?I said, I sure did!...and held up my thumb to show her.
Joe was moderately successful in his career, but as he got older he was increasingly hampered by incredible headaches. When his personal hygiene and love life started to suffer, he sought medical help. After being referred from one specialist to another, he finally came across a doctor who solved the problem. The good news is I can cure your headaches; the bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press up against the base of your spine. The pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles. Joe was shocked and depressed, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife. After the operation, his mind was clear, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. He walked past a men's clothing store and thought, That's what I need, a new suit. He entered the shop and told the salesman, I'd like a new suit. The salesman eyed him briefly and said, Let's see, size 44 long? Joe laughed, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. replied the salesman. Joe tried on the suit, and it fit him perfectly. As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, How about a new shirt? Joe thought for a moment and then said, Sure!. The salesman eyed Joe, then said, Let's see, 34 sleeve and 16 and a half neck.. Joe was surprised, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. came the familiar reply. Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly, as well. The salesman asked, How about new shoes?. Joe was on a roll and agreed. The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, Let's see, nine-and-a-half? Joe was astonished, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. said the salesman, again. Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly, again. He walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, How about some new underwear? Joe thought for a second and said, Sure, why not. The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, Let's see, size 36. Joe laughed smugly, No, I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old. The shocked salesman shook his head, You can't possibly wear a size 34!	It would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache.

As such I offer a full apology for making the claim that it encourages suicide bombing and violence.OK, there - I said it.	Now can you please stop sending me death threats?

An atheist dies and goes to hell. The devil welcomes him and says:Let me show you around a little bit.They walk through a nice park with green trees and the devil shows him a huge palace. This is your house now, here are your keys.The man is happy and thanks the devil. The devil says:No need to say thank you, everyone gets a nice place to live in when they come down here!They continue walking through the nice park, flowers everywhere, and the devil shows the atheist a garage full of beautiful cars. These are your cars now! and hands the man all the car keys. Again, the atheist tries to thank the devil, but he only says Everyone down here gets some cool cars! How would you drive around without having cars?.They walk on and the area gets even nicer. There are birds chirping, squirrels running around, kittens everywhere.They arrive at a fountain, where the most beautiful woman the atheist has ever seen sits on a bench. She looks at him and they instantly fall in love with each other. The man couldn´t be any happier. The devil says Everyone gets to have their soulmate down here, we don´t want anyone to be lonely!As they walk on, the atheist notices a high fence. He peeks to the other side and is totally shocked. There are people in pools of lava, screaming in pain, while little devils run around and stab them with their tridents. Other devils are skinning people alive, heads are spiked, and many more terrible things are happening.	A stench of sulfur is in the air.Terrified, the man stumbles backwards, and asks the devil What is going on there?The devil just shrugs and says: Those are the christians, I don´t know why, but they prefer it that wayedit: fucked up punchline, thanks to u/Tjurit for pointing ou

One day a man hears that a distant uncle passed away. He's a little sad, but only a little, for they barely knew each other. Then, a few days later, a package arrives. It contains his inheritance from the estate: A violin and a painting. He has no idea what to do with them. After pondering the matter, he takes them to an appraiser.

And she noticed... What's wrong? Scarlett Johansson asked, Nothing... the guy would say...She pestered him for a while eventually saying she would do ANYTHING he needed or wanted to make him feel good again, just because she really cared for him a lot, and even if he wasn't asking, she felt it was the least she owed it to him...Really?, you'll do anything I'd like?yes she said anything!ok, first i want you to take off you toga and get into this pair of work jeans that somehow washed on the shoreok...now put this shirt on please, but first, tape your boobs so they are flatwha... ok, I'd say I'd do anything she said lovingly.ok, now, take this hat and wear it, but tuck your hair under itShe was kinda confused, but non the less, she wanted to make him happy, so she tucked her hair under the hat.Now id like for you to grab this piece of soot and paint yourself a beard and a mustacheok... if this is what you want... she muttered.now, please, put on these sunglasses, and start walking down the beach I'll catch up to you in a bit, he said a bit excited...She started walking... wondering... doubting herself... just confused about what had just happened, maybe it wasn't her, maybe it was h... suddenly the guy grabs her by her shoulder turns her around and says: DUDE!!!	you won't believe who I've been fucking for the past 6 months!

He sang like an opera baritone and danced like a Broadway star and you should have heard him play the piano. He was an amazing guy. Passenger: Sounds like he was really something special. Cabbie: There's more. He had a memory like a computer. He remembered everybody's birthday. He knew all about wine, which foods to order and which fork to eat them with. He could fix anything. Not like me. I change a fuse, and the whole street blacks out. But Frank Feldman could do everything right. Passenger: Wow, what a guy! Cabbie: He always knew the quickest way to go in traffic and avoid traffic jams. Not like me, I always seem to get stuck in them. But Frank, he never made a mistake, and he really knew how to treat a woman and make her feel good. He would never answer her back even if she was in the wrong; and his clothing was always immaculate, shoes highly polished too. He was the perfect man! He never made a mistake. No one could ever measure up to Frank Feldman. Passenger: How did you meet him? Cabbie: I never actually met Frank.	He died and I married his wife.

A Southern Baptist minister was addressing his congregation. Today I am a sad man. And I’m gonna tell you why I am a sad man. I am a sad man because a member of this church has been spreading the word that I am a member of the Ku Klux Klan. That person has not had the courage to speak this falsehood to my face, so I call upon them to stand up now before you all and tell me why they have been peddling such malicious lies.An attractive blonde woman stood up nervously.You? said the minister, shocked. My own sister-in-law? How could you say such things about me?I didn’t mean any harm, said the woman. It was all a terrible misunderstanding.	All I did was tell my friend you were a wizard beneath the sheets!
A college professor started to notice that one of his students, Dave, started gaining lots of female attention. So, one day he asks Dave about his secret.

A woman joins a country club and when she hears the guys talking about their golf round, she says, I played on my college's golf team. I was pretty good. Mind if I join you next week? No one wants to say 'yes', but they're on the spot.  Finally, one man says, Okay, but we start at 6:30 a.m.He figures the early tee-time will discourage her.The woman says this may be a problem and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late.They roll their eyes, but say, Okay.She's there at 6:30 am. sharp and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round.She's fun and pleasant and the guys are impressed.They congratulate her and invite her back the next week.She smiles, and says, I'll be there at 6:30, or 6:45.The next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp.Only this time, she plays left-handed.The three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand.They're totally amazed.They can't figure her out.She's very pleasant and a gracious winner.They invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.The third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys.This week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them.The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part.However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.This woman is a riddle no one can figure out.They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse and finally, one of the men asks her, How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?The lady blushes, and grins. When my dad taught me to play golf, I learned that I was ambidextrous. she replies. I like to switch back and forth.When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him.	If his willie points to the right, I golf right-handed; if it points to the left, I golf left-handed.The guys think this is hysterical.Astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys says, What if it's pointing straight up?She says, Then, I'm fifteen minutes late.
An Italian funeral. A Jewish man was leaving a convenience store with his espresso when he noticed a most unusual Italian funeral procession approaching the nearby cemetery.

Whose funeral, is it?My wife's. ''What happened to her?She yelled at me and my dog attacked and killed her.He inquired further, But who is in the second hearse?My mother-in-law.

One day Mike says, Joe, we both loved football all our lives, and we played football on Saturdays together for so many years. Please do me one favour, when you get to Heaven, somehow you must let me know if there's football there.Joe looks up at Mike from his death bed, Mike, you've been my best friend for many years. If it's at all possible, I'll do this favour for you.Shortly after that, Joe passes on.At midnight a couple of nights later, Mike is awakened from a sound sleep by a blinding flash of white light and a voice calling out to him, Mike--Mike.Who is it? asks Mike sitting up suddenly. Who is it?Mike--it's me, Joe.You're not Joe. Joe just died.I'm telling you, it's me, Joe, insists the voice.Joe! Where are you?In heaven, replies Joe. I have some really good news and a little bad news.Tell me the good news first, says Mike.The good news, Joe says, is that there's football in heaven. Better yet, all of our old friends who died before us are here, too. Better than that, we're all young again. Better still, it's always spring time and it never rains or snows. And best of all, we can play football all we want, and we never get tired.That's fantastic, says Mike. It's beyond my wildest dreams!	So what's the bad news?You're on the team for this Saturday's match!

I'm certainly not looking for an argument.They look over at the third bull and find him pawing the dirt, shaking his horns and snorting.First Bull: Son, don't be foolish -- let him have some of your cows and live to tell about it.Third Bull: Hell, he can have all my cows.	I'm just making sure he knows I'm a bull.

Stoner Joke. Three Men Died and Went to Hell Where They Met the Devil. (Warning! Long one) Three men died and went to hell where they met the Devil. The Devil told them that they had sinned in life and therefore had to spend the next 666 years in hell to atone for their sins. However, since the Devil wasn't entirely merciless, he would let them choose for themselves how they were going to spend those 666 years. And so the Devil let the men to three doors.Going through the first door, they entered what looked to be a normal bar. Although, if you were there for more than an hour, you would notice that no matter how much you tried to drink another bottle would appear on the shelf. And even better, the bar always had the exact drink you wanted available. An unlimited supply of every alcoholic beverage in existence. It was, in short, a drunkard's paradise.When they entered the second door, they were greeted by a myriad of women all ready to satisfy every sexual desire they could possible have. There were multiple women of every shape, size and ethnicity imaginable. Looking closer you would notice that there were even celebrity and work crushes from your life in the crowd. Every single one of them ready  to please you. It was, in short, a pervert's paradiseFinally, when they entered the third door, they found themselves in a forest made of cannabis. The ground was made of kief, all the bushes wore beatiful buds and even the trees were 20 feet tall cannabis plants. There were every strain it has or ever will be possible to grow. You could even find rocks of hashish laying around the forest floor if you looked closely. It was, in short, a stoner's paradise.The Devil asked the men which room they each wanted. The words had barely left the Devil's mouth before the first man ran directly to the room with a myriad of women. The second man then went to the room with the bar, thinking that if he was going to spend 666 years in hell, he might as well be drunk for most of it. Lastly, the third man, thinking he had won the lottery, gladly went towards the room with the forest of cannabis.666 years later, the Devil returned to see if the men had atoned for their sins.When he opened the first door, bottles slowly rolled out and you could immediately smell piss and puke coming from the room. It took the Devil a while, but he finally found the man nestled between the bottles, smeared in his own shit and puke, and with arguably the worst hangover in history. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.When he opened the second door, he was overwhelmed with the sound of hundreds of crying children and angry women. Not ten seconds after the door opened, the man came running, pleading for the Devil to please let him out. There were kids of every age running around screaming and all the women were angry at each other, while everyone, children and mothers alike, were angry at the man. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.When the Devil opened the third door, he immediately saw the man sitting cross legged in a giant pool of his own tears. The Devil had not expected this. Confused, he went to ask the man what was wrong.	The man, tears still running down his face, looked up at the Devil and said:I don't have a lighter

A farmer has 895 sheep. Realising that this is quite a lot of sheep for one farm, and Jess the sheepdog is getting a bit old, he decides he'll probably need a new dog- no, a whole team of dogs- to round so many sheep up.So the next day, the farmer goes to the pet store. He looks around at the various herding dogs- they seem very fit, but young and untrained. The shopkeeper asks the farmer if he wants any help.Why yes, says the farmer. I need a team of sheepdogs to help round up my flock. I have a rather large number of sheep, you see, and I don't think any of these young pups would be up to the task of rounding up so many.The shopkeeper says, I've got just the thing for you. and leads the farmer into a small back room, where a single sheepdog sits waiting.Are you sure? asks the farmer, I have very many sheep and I don't think one dog will be able to round all of them up..I'm sure. says the shopkeeper, This is a very intelligent dog. He's been well-trained for many jobs and has skills beyond any other dog I've ever seen.Yes, says the dog, I know six languages, eight martial arts and I have a degree in engineering.The farmer, clearly very impressed by this dog- who wouldn't be impressed by that?- decides to take him home.That afternoon, the farmer and the dog walk together up hill, and from the top they can see the entire flock covering the fields.Well, says the farmer, I'd like you to round up all of these sheep..Okay.	replies the dog, You have nine hundred sheep.

A man walks into a bar and asks the bartender,   If I show you a really good trick, will you give me a free drink? The bartender considers it, then agrees. The man reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tiny rat. He reaches into his other pocket and pulls out a tiny piano. The rat stretches, cracks his knuckles, and proceeds to play the blues. The bartender pours the man a drink on the house and he puts the rat and piano away. After the man finished his drink, he asked the bartender, If I show you an even better trick, will you give me free drinks for the rest of the evening? The bartender agrees, thinking that no trick could possibly be better than the first. The man reaches into his pockets again and pulls out the tiny rat and tiny piano. The rat stretches, cracks his knuckles, and proceeds to play the blues. The man reaches into a third pocket and pulls out a small bullfrog, who begins to sing along with the rat's music. While the man is enjoying his beverages, a stranger confronts him and offers him $100,000.00 for the bullfrog. Sorry, the man replies, he's not for sale. The stranger increases the offer to $250,000.00 cash up front. No, he insists, he's not for sale. The stranger again increases the offer, this time to $500,000.00 cash. The man finally agrees, and turns the frog over to the stranger in exchange for the money. Are you insane? the bartender demanded. That frog could have been worth millions to you, and you let him go for a mere $500,000! Don't worry about it, the man answered. The frog was nothing special.	You see, the rat's a ventriloquist.

A man who just died is delivered to the mortuary wearing an expensive, expertly tailored black suit... .... The mortician asks the deceased's wife how she would like the body dressed. He points out that the man does look good in the black suit he is already wearing.The widow, however, says that she always thought her husband looked his best in blue, and that she wants him in a blue suit. She gives the mortician a blank check and says, I don't care what it costs, but please have my husband in a blue suit for the viewing.The woman returns the next day for the wake. To her delight, she finds her husband dressed in a gorgeous blue suit with a subtle chalk stripe; the suit fits him perfectly.She says to the mortician, Whatever this cost, I'm very satisfied. You did an excellent job and I'm very grateful. How much did you spend?To her astonishment, the mortician presents her with the blank check.There's no charge, he says.No, really, I must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit! she says.Honestly, ma'am, the mortician says, it cost nothing. You see, a deceased gentleman of about your husband's size was brought in shortly after you left yesterday, and he was wearing an attractive blue suit.	I asked his wife if she minded him going to his grave wearing a black suit instead, and she said it made no difference as long as he looked nice.Then it was just a matter of switching the heads
Two married buddies are out drinking one night, when one turns to the other and says... You know, I don't know what else to do. Whenever I go home after we've been out drinking, I turn the headlights off before I get to the driveway. I shut off the engine and coast into the garage. I take my shoes off before I go into the house, I sneak up the stairs, I get undressed in the bathroom. I ease into bed and my wife STILL wakes up and yells at me for staying out so late!His buddy looks at him and says, Well, you're obviously taking the wrong approach. I screech into the driveway, slam the door, storm up the steps, throw my shoes into the closet, jump into bed, rub my hands on my wife's ass and say, 'How about a blowjob?'	... and she's always sound asleep.
One afternoon this guy drives down a highway to visit a nearby lake and relax. On his way to the lake he sees one guy dressed from head to toe in red standing on the side of the highway gesturing him to stop.Our guy rolls down the window and asks, How can I help you?I am the red bastard of the asphalt, you got something to eat?With a smile on his face he hands one of his sandwiches to the red dressed guy and drives away. Not even five minutes later he comes across another guy.This time the guy is dressed fully in yellow, standing on the side and waving him to stop.A bit irritated our guy stops, cranks down the window and asks, What can I do for you?I am the yellow bastard of the asphalt, you got something to drink?Hardly managing to smile this time he hands to the guy a can of soda and then stomps on the pedal and takes off again.In order to make it to the lakeside before sunset he decides to go faster and not to stop no matter what.To his frustration he sees another guy on the side of the road, dressed all in blue, making a hand signal to stop him.Not quite willing our guy decides to stop a last time.He rolls his window down and yells to the guy, I know, you’re the blue bastard of the asphalt.	But just what the heck do you want?Driver’s license and registration please.

With the worst premonition, I opened the envelope and read the letter, with trembling hands... Dear, Dad.It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you.I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.I've been finding real passion with Stacy.She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes and because she is so much older than I am.But it's not only the passion, Dad.She's pregnant.Stacy said that we will be very happy.She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter.We share a dream of having many more children.Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone.We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better.She sure deserves it!Don't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself.Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.Love, your son, Joshua.P.S.	Dad, none of the above is true.I'm over at Jason's house.I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that's on the kitchen table.Call when it is safe for me to come home!

An HR manager was knocked down (tragically) by a bus and was killed. Her soul arrived at the Pearly Gates, where St.Peter welcomed her. Before you get settled in he said, We have a little problem…you see, we’ve never had a HR manager make it this far before and we’re not really sure what to do with you.Oh, I see, said the woman, can’t you just let me in?Well, I’d like to, said St Peter, But I have higher orders. We’re instructed to let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you’d like to go for all eternity.Actually, I think I’d prefer heaven, said the woman. Sorry, we have rules… at which St. Peter put the HR manager into the downward bound elevator.As the doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times.They played a perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed a superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had a wonderful night telling jokes and dancing.Before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. Now it’s time to spend a day in heaven, he said.So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day’s end St. Peter returned. So, he said, You’ve spent a day in hell and you’ve spent a day in heaven. You must choose between the two.The woman thought for a second and replied: Well, heaven is certainly lovely, but I actually had a better time in hell. I choose Hell.Accordingly, St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her.I don’t understand, stuttered the HR manager, The other day I was here, and there was a golf course, and a country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had a wonderful happy time.	Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.The Devil simply looked at her and smiled, Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you’re staff.
Oh, how nice (A joke from my 96 year old great-grandmother-in-law) Two women are in the hospital. Their labor has started, but not progressed enough for delivery, so they are in a room waiting together.Is this your first child? says the older woman.No, says the younger woman. I have another.I have three. Continues the older woman. After the first kid, my husband was so sweet. He bought me a diamond necklace.Oh, how nice. Said the young woman.After the second, he bought me a new car. He said I deserve the best.Oh, how nice. Said the younger woman.And after the third, he bought us a new house. It was expensive, but he said his family was worth it.Oh, how nice. Said the younger woman.So, what has your husband gotten you?Well, we only have one child. After he was born, my husband thought I needed to clean up my language, so he got me lessons at charm school.Is that so?Yes.	Now instead of saying 'go fuck yourself,' I say 'oh, how nice'.

The reporter ate it and said Now, I can die.The BBC Reporter said, I’m a reporter to the end. I want to take out my tape recorder and describe the scene here and what’s about to happen. Maybe someday someone will hear it and know that I was on the job till the end.The ISIS leader directed an aide to hand over the tape recorder and dictated some comments. The reporter then said, Now I can die knowing I stayed true until the end.The ISIS leader turned to the Israeli commando and said, And now, Mr. Israeli tough guy, what is your final wish?Kick me in the butt , said the soldier.What? asked the leader, Will you mock us in your last hour?No, I’m not kidding. I want you to kick me in the butt , insisted the Israeli.So the terrorist leader shoved him into the open and kicked him in the behind. The soldier went sprawling, but rolled to his knees, pulled a 9 mm pistol from under his flak jacket, and shot the leader dead. In the resulting confusion, he jumped to his knapsack, pulled out his carbine and sprayed the terrorists with gunfire. In a flash, all terrorists were either dead or fleeing for their lives. As the soldier was untying the reporters, they asked him, Why didn’t you just shoot them in the beginning? Why did you ask them to kick you in the butt first?What?	replied the Israeli, and have you report that I was the aggressor?
Joe was moderately successful in his career, but as he got older he was increasingly hampered by incredible headaches. When his personal hygiene and love life started to suffer, he sought medical help. After being referred from one specialist to another, he finally came across a doctor who solved the problem. The good news is I can cure your headaches; the bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press up against the base of your spine. The pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles. Joe was shocked and depressed, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife. After the operation, his mind was clear, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. He walked past a men's clothing store and thought, That's what I need, a new suit. He entered the shop and told the salesman, I'd like a new suit. The salesman eyed him briefly and said, Let's see, size 44 long? Joe laughed, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. replied the salesman. Joe tried on the suit, and it fit him perfectly. As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, How about a new shirt? Joe thought for a moment and then said, Sure!. The salesman eyed Joe, then said, Let's see, 34 sleeve and 16 and a half neck.. Joe was surprised, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. came the familiar reply. Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly, as well. The salesman asked, How about new shoes?. Joe was on a roll and agreed. The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, Let's see, nine-and-a-half? Joe was astonished, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. said the salesman, again. Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly, again. He walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, How about some new underwear? Joe thought for a second and said, Sure, why not. The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, Let's see, size 36. Joe laughed smugly, No, I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old. The shocked salesman shook his head, You can't possibly wear a size 34!	It would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache.

My grandfather died and I inherited some of his clothes. He was a farmer and he loved getting dressed up every year for the local fair and exhibiting his prize chickens. For this occasion, my grandmother would spend the entire year searching through thrift shops looking for silly neckties for him to wear, and she loved finding ones with chickens on them.After a few decades of this, my grandfather had amassed several dozen neckties, each one with cartoonish images of chickens flying around, laying eggs, and doing other chicken things. I always complimented him on the newest addition to his collection.When he died a couple of years ago, he bequeathed them to me in his will. When my grandmother handed me the bag full of them, my eyes welled with tears and I smiled thinking about my grandfather looking in the mirror and straightening his tie.Why am I telling you all of this back story?	Because the last time I tried to tell this to someone and I didn't give context, they thought it was weird that I was so excited about inheriting my dead grandfather's hen tie collection.

Sales pitch. Bubba Joe's first military assignment was to a military induction center, and, because he was a good talker, they assigned him the duty of advising new recruits about the government benefits, especially the GI insurance to which they were entitled.Before long the Captain in charge of the induction center began noticing that Bubba was getting a 99 percent sign-up for the top GI insurance.This was odd, because it would cost these poor inductees nearly $30.00 per month more for their higher coverage than what the government was already granting.The Captain decided that he would sit in the back of the room and observe Bubba's sales pitch. Bubba Joe stood up before his latest group of inductees and stated, If you have the normal GI insurance and go to Iraq and are killed, the government pays your beneficiary $6,000. If you take out the supplemental GI insurance, which will cost you an additional $30.00 per month, the government pays your beneficiary $200,000.	Now, Bubba concluded, which bunch do you think they're gonna send into combat first?

So a gorilla dies of old age at a zoo... ...right before the zoo opens. It is the only gorilla at the zoo since they are not very profitable. However, the gorilla is their most popular attraction by far, and they cannot afford to go a day without it.

Bangidy, bang, bang, bang. The next week, they start bayonet training. Again Sam is at the end of the line and again they run out just before they get to him. The Sergeant tells him to just pretend he has a bayonet at the end of his pretend rifle. So Sam goes running through the mock battle with his stick yelling, Bangidy, bang, bang, bang. Stabidy, stab, stab,stab. Well the unit finished basic training and gets called up to go into real battle. Our hapless hero finds himself eventually on a landing craft, hitting the beach. Unfortunately, they have never given him a real rifle and he still has his stick. He is wondering what in the heck he is going to do. As the unit fights his way inland, Sam mindlessly points his stick at an enemy soldier standing on a hill and yells, Bangidy, bang, bang, bang. To his amazement, the enemy soldier falls over dead! So he  aims his stick at another and yells, Bangidy, bang, bang, bang. And that enemy falls over dead! Now our hero is running madly along, pointing his stick at any enemy soldier he sees, yelling Bangidy, bang, bang, bang. Enemy soldiers are dropping like flies! An enemy jumps out from a bush beside him. Sam points his stick and yells, Stabidy, stab, stab, stab. The  other guy drops and writhes in pain. All of a sudden an enemy soldier comes walking slowly along a path. Sam carefully aims his stick at the soldier and yells, Bangidy,  bang, bang, bang. But the enemy soldier just keeps coming. Sam tries again, Bangidy, bang, bang, bang! Nothing. As the enemy soldier gets closer, Sam cries out, Stabidy, stab, stab, stab. But the enemy soldier runs right over him, crushing him.	As Sam lies dying, he hears the enemy soldier muttering, Tankidy, tank, tank, tank.

A married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine that would transfer a portion of the mother's labor pain to the father. He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it.The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine.The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him. The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain.	She and her husband were ecstatic.When they got home, the mailman was dead on the porch.

It's hanging down, because it's looking at my new boots!!!! Without missing a beat Margaret replied, should have bought a hat, Robert!	Should have bought a hat.
As a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: 5 lamb chops, please.  Amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop. He follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and trot across the road to a bus-stop. The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench. When a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus. The butcher follows, dumbstruck. As the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery. After awhile he stands on his back paws to push the stop bell, then the butcher follows him off. The dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step. He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door. He does this again and again. No answer. So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window, jumps off, and waits at the front door. A big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog. The butcher runs up and screams at the guy: What the hell are you doing? This dog's a genius! The owner responds, Genius, my ass.........	It's the second time this week he's forgotten his keys!

Tom's scrotum.  The pastor asked if anyone in the congregation would like to express praise for answered prayers.Suzie Smith stood and walked to the podium.She said, I have a praise.Two months ago, my husband, Tom, had a terrible bicycle wreck and his scrotum was completely crushed. The pain was excruciating and the doctors didn't know if they could help him. (You could hear a muffled gasp from the men in the congregation as they imagine the pain that poor Tom must have experienced. )Tom was unable to hold me or the children, she went on, and every move caused him terrible pain.We prayed as the doctors performed a delicate operation, and it turned out they were able to piece together the crushed remnants of Tom's scrotum, and wrap wire around it to hold it in place. (Again, the men in the congregation cringed and squirm uncomfortably as they imagined the horrible surgery performed on Tom. )Now, she announced in a quivering voice, thank the Lord, Tom is out of the hospital and the doctors say that with time, his scrotum should recover completely. (All the men sighed with unified relief. )The pastor rose and tentatively asked if anyone else had something to say.A man slowly stood up and walked just as slowly to the podium.He said, I'm Tom Smith.	The entire congregation held its breath.I just want to tell my wife -- the word is sternum.

A policeman was interrogating 3 guys who were training to become detectives. To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first guys a picture for 5 seconds and then hides it. This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?The first guy answers, That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye! The policeman says, Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile.Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?The second guy smiles, flips his hair, and says, Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!The policeman angrily responds, What's the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, This is your suspect, how would you recognize him? He quickly adds, Think hard before giving me a stupid answer.The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, the suspect wears contact lenses.The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not. Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that. He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?That's easy, the third guy replied.	He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear.

In a crowded city at a bus stop, a beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in a tight leather mini skirt, with matching tight leather boots and jacket... As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus. Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't! So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. With a coy little smile to the driver, she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step.About this time, a big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, How dare you touch my body!!	I don't even know who you are!At this, the Texan drawled, Well ma'am normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends.

There's a little-known legend about Attila the Hun... The story goes that Attila used to collect exotic animals that he found during his conquests. He particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was a giant snake. He was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign.But his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet.Wishing to save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent.	Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.Curious, Attila did as he asked.Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.Now hold these in both hands, he instructed.Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.To an amazed Attila, the old man simply said,Thy anaconda don't want nun unless you've got buns, Hun.

NSFW In honor of my Father, his favorite joke of all time. No one could tell it like he did. Christmas was coming and Little Johnny’s Mom and Dad took him to the mall to a see Santa Claus.Johnny walked up and sat on Santa’s lap and said Santa, for Christmas I want a god damn new baseball bat and I want it to be put under my god damn bed. I want a god damn new baseball glove, and I want it put under the god damn Christmas tree. And Santa, I want a god damn new bike and I want it put under a god damn tarp in the god damn shed.Santa, in complete shock, pulled Little Johnny’s parents aside and said In all my years, I have never seen a little boy with such a foul mouth.His parents replied We know, but we have no idea what to do about his behavior. We’ve tried everything.Santa thought about it and said Here’s what we’ll do to teach him a lesson, every place that Johnny asked for a present, we’ll put a pile of dog poop. The parents agreed to try Santa’s plan.On Christmas morning, Little Johnny woke up and immediately looked under his bed. Seeing the pile of poop, he ran downstairs to the Christmas tree and checked underneath.Finding another pile of poop under the tree, he ran out the door and threw open the shed door. Finding a tarp in the shed, he quickly pulled back the tarp and found yet another pile of poop.Johnny walked out of the shed and started looking all around the yard.	After a while his parents asked him sarcastically So Little Johnny, what did you get for Christmas?Without missing a beat, Johnny looked at his parents and said I think I got a god damned dog, but I can’t find the motherfucker!

Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community... If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each otherThe Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.The Rabbi pulled out an apple.With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue! 'Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.	'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'

A policeman was interrogating 3 guys who were training to become detectives. To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first guys a picture for 5 seconds and then hides it. This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?The first guy answers, That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye! The policeman says, Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile.Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?The second guy smiles, flips his hair, and says, Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!The policeman angrily responds, What's the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, This is your suspect, how would you recognize him? He quickly adds, Think hard before giving me a stupid answer.The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, the suspect wears contact lenses.The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not. Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that. He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?That's easy, the third guy replied.	He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear.

So two aliens find their way to earth.  They land in the Arizona desert near a gas station that was closed for the night. They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien addressed it saying, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.The gas pump, of course, didn't respond.The younger alien became angry at the lack of response.The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you. 'The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response.Pissed at  the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said gruffly, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader or I will fire!The older alien again warned his comrade saying,  'You probably don't want to do that! I really think that will make him mad. ''Rubbish,' replied the cocky, young alien. He aimed his weapon  and opened fire. There was a huge explosion. A massive fireball roared towards him and blew the younger alien off his feet and threw him in a burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch.Half an hour passed. When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head. 'What a ferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien. 'He damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?	'The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, 'If there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you never mess with a guy who can loop his dick over his shoulder twice and then stick it in his ear.'

Once upon a time there lived a ravishing Queen with huge tits.. Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear.

Man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.You're in the afterlife! he tells the man, But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.What are the odds? they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line. The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. Come, the beggar told him, I'll take you to the evening meal. So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line, and then he added, and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. What is it, he thought, that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here? That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.The beggar laughed jovially. I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in! Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. That's the line for the dragon meat, he said before turning to the next line, and that's the line for angeldust stew, then he paused, confused.What is it?	the man asked his old friend.The beggar replied, There appears to be no punchline.

I am offering you three, take it or leave it.Man: Ok, I'll take three but you have to give me your word. You can't backtrack on any of these.God: Do you doubt my power? I can do anything. Of course I won't backtrack. I give you my word.Man: First wish, I wish that the hammer in your hand would turn into a stick.God: (*laughing*) You really *are* insane. All the things in the whole world and you wish for this?? Ok whatever, here you go.Hammer turns into stick.Man: Now I wish that you put that stick up your arse.God: (*furiously*) What?!! How dare you ask for such a thing. Man:You gave me your word. This is my second wish.	You have to do it.God: (*hesitantly*) Ok fine.Puts the stick up his arse.Man: Now dear Sucellus, are you giving me my ten wishes or you want me to turn that stick back into hammer again.

So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living. He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said, Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just a bad conductor.

A priest told me this joke as a kid. There were 3 men, they were best friends, and they were quite unhealthy. Their names were, Bert, Chester, and Earl.They were actually really unhealthy and Bert decided that he needed to take charge of him and his friends' health. He decided that they were going to be on a diet together to help them live for as long as possible. He broke the news to his friends, and they weren't too happy about it, but they decided to go along with it anyways, because they knew how out-of-shape they all were. It was tough for them all to stick to the plan at times, however they got through it together. They each lost between 120-140 pounds over the course of 20 years and were in amazing shape for their age.One day the 3 of them were given great news.Bert got a call, he answered it, then turned around to everyone and said: Guys! My daughter just had a child! I'm going to be a grandpa!. Everybody was celebrating for Bert when Earl got a call from his son. He answered it, and turned around to everybody and said:Guys! My son is going to get married today! I'm so excited!. Everybody was now celebrating for Bert and Earl, when Chester got a call. He answered it, turned around and said to everybody: Guys! My family is having a reunion today! I'm going to see so many people that I haven't seen in years!.They found out that the wedding, hospital, and park where the reunion was were all in the same town, and decided to carpool together to get there. It had snowed a little the day before and the roads were a little icy. As they were getting onto the highway, their car slipped and ran into a semi-truck. It killed all three of them.The three of them wake up together in heaven. They notice an angel standing over them and one of them asks Where are we?. The angels says: Congratulations, you made it to heaven. The angel decides to show them around the place and starts at a banquet. Here is a banquet for you three to enjoy, you've earned it. Chester looks a little sad, and Earl notices and asks him, What's wrong?. Chester finally speaks up, Okay, this is so nice of you to put together, but we're on a diet. I wouldn't want to overdo my calorie intake for the day. The angle replies to them, No worries, you can have as much food as you like without worrying about it. The guys are elated by that news, when the angel decides to show them another place.Next, the angel decides to show them a place where they can spend time having fun. He shows them to a massive building with games everywhere you look. There are at least 50 pool tables, 30 bowling alley lanes, people are playing poker, there are arcade games everywhere, and tons of people enjoying themselves. He tells them,This is where you may spend much of your time, if you choose. Many people enjoy it here and you might find some new friends. The guys really like this room, but Earl notices that Chester is looking sad again. Earls asks him,What's wrong?. Chester responds with,My wife left me because of my gambling problems, I don't want to disappoint anyone else because of it. I'm afraid I wont be able to enjoy this area. The angel then slightly irritated lets him know,Don't you see? There are no problems here. You don't have to worry about gambling issues, because money isn't an issue here. Chester is especially happy to hear that news, and the angel decides to show them where they are going to live.The angel finally takes them to the third place, and it is a huge mansion. The guys are led inside, when the angel says, This is where you three can live, if you choose to. Otherwise we have some other mansions, if you want to live alone. The guys are very intrigued by the house, they notice a big window on a wall with an amazing view. They could see for at least 5 miles clearly. They all can't help but gasp when looking through the window. Earl can't help but be concerned about this place. He decides to ask, So, uh... What's the rent here?. The angel looks back at them with an irritated glare are replies Nothing? It's free. Earl is sure to thank the angel and says,Wow! That's so kind of you guys!. Bert notices that Chester is looking a little sad. Bert says,What's wrong Chester? Isn't it amazing here?. Chester looks up, looks Bert in the eye and says a little mad, If it weren't for your goddamn diet. Bert.	We could've been here 20 years ago!.

Once upon a time in an old magical kingdom, there lived an young monk called Sam... His order was renowned for their beautiful choralsinging. They trained, hours every day, refiningtheir voices and their art. Their song floateddown the mountainside, enriching the lives andsouls of the townspeople belowSam was particularly gifted, and on his 19thbirthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifullyintricate note of pure magic. Everyone withinmiles just froze in mid action, stirred to the verycore of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.And all the realm realized, instantly, that it wasSam, and Sam was the first person in historyto hit one of the rumored Magical Notes thatmusicians had theorized must exist... yet no onebefore Sam had ever reached one.And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.This time, the town below was so impactedthat no one moved, spoke, or even blink forseveral minutes after. As the golden sound finallytapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam hadfound the Second Note...And the next year on Sam's birthday, the townhad realized there was a pattern involved. Thistime, all of the townspeople were present in themonastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hitthe glorious Third Note. People cried out in purepurejoy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.Words cannot do justice to the experience.

All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From thestart, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and thisnew sound was not beautiful... it was jarring anddiscordant.

Stoner Joke. Three Men Died and Went to Hell Where They Met the Devil. (Warning! Long one) Three men died and went to hell where they met the Devil. The Devil told them that they had sinned in life and therefore had to spend the next 666 years in hell to atone for their sins. However, since the Devil wasn't entirely merciless, he would let them choose for themselves how they were going to spend those 666 years. And so the Devil let the men to three doors.Going through the first door, they entered what looked to be a normal bar. Although, if you were there for more than an hour, you would notice that no matter how much you tried to drink another bottle would appear on the shelf. And even better, the bar always had the exact drink you wanted available. An unlimited supply of every alcoholic beverage in existence. It was, in short, a drunkard's paradise.When they entered the second door, they were greeted by a myriad of women all ready to satisfy every sexual desire they could possible have. There were multiple women of every shape, size and ethnicity imaginable. Looking closer you would notice that there were even celebrity and work crushes from your life in the crowd. Every single one of them ready  to please you. It was, in short, a pervert's paradiseFinally, when they entered the third door, they found themselves in a forest made of cannabis. The ground was made of kief, all the bushes wore beatiful buds and even the trees were 20 feet tall cannabis plants. There were every strain it has or ever will be possible to grow. You could even find rocks of hashish laying around the forest floor if you looked closely. It was, in short, a stoner's paradise.The Devil asked the men which room they each wanted. The words had barely left the Devil's mouth before the first man ran directly to the room with a myriad of women. The second man then went to the room with the bar, thinking that if he was going to spend 666 years in hell, he might as well be drunk for most of it. Lastly, the third man, thinking he had won the lottery, gladly went towards the room with the forest of cannabis.666 years later, the Devil returned to see if the men had atoned for their sins.When he opened the first door, bottles slowly rolled out and you could immediately smell piss and puke coming from the room. It took the Devil a while, but he finally found the man nestled between the bottles, smeared in his own shit and puke, and with arguably the worst hangover in history. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.When he opened the second door, he was overwhelmed with the sound of hundreds of crying children and angry women. Not ten seconds after the door opened, the man came running, pleading for the Devil to please let him out. There were kids of every age running around screaming and all the women were angry at each other, while everyone, children and mothers alike, were angry at the man. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.When the Devil opened the third door, he immediately saw the man sitting cross legged in a giant pool of his own tears. The Devil had not expected this. Confused, he went to ask the man what was wrong.	The man, tears still running down his face, looked up at the Devil and said:I don't have a lighter

As a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: 5 lamb chops, please. Amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop.He follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, andtrot across the road to a bus-stop.The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench.When a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus.The butcher follows, dumbstruck.As the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery.After awhile he stands on his back paws to push the stop bell,then the butcher follows him off.The dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step.He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door.He does this again and again.	No answer.So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window,jumps off, and waits at the front door.A big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog.The butcher runs up and screams at the guy: What the hell are you doing?This dog's a genius!The owner responds, Genius, my ass.........It's the second time this week he's forgotten his keys!

If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it... 	...then my illegal logging business is a success.
On the lowest branch of a tree, there is a caterpillar looking at a bud. Hungrily, it says: I'll be damned if don't eat this bud. But I'll wait until it has bloomed so that I can go and fill my belly !! and then it waits patiently for the bud to bloom. Higher on that tree, a sparrow is looking at the caterpillar and says: I'll be damned if don't eat this caterpillar. But I'll wait until it has eaten the bud so that I can go and fill my belly!! and then it waits patiently for the caterpillar to eat the bud. Watching from another branch, a hawk hungrily looks at the sparrow and says: I'll be damned if don't eat this sparrow. But I will wait until it has eaten the caterpillar so that I can go and fill my belly. and then it waits patiently for the sparrow to eat the caterpillar.At the base of the tree, a cat is watching all this unfold and hungrily says:  I'll be damned if I don't eat this hawk. But I will wait until the hawk has eaten the sparrow so that I can go and fill my belly. and then waits for the right moment to jump on the hawk.A few moment pass and the bud starts to bloom.	Seeing this, the caterpillar goes and rushes for the bud, devouring the flower that started to bloom.Not wanting to miss his chance, the sparrow dives and goes for the caterpillar, eating it whole.With piercing eyes, the hawk reacts fast and swoops down on the sparrow, killing it with a swift strike.Having been preparing for a deadly attack on the hawk, the cat leaps on the branch and attempts to maul its prey.The total weight of the animals making the branch more frail, it breaks and the cat falls into a puddle of water.Moral of the story: the longer the build-up, the wetter the pussy.

Two Americans are touring Europe, and are scheduled to arrive in France Sunday afternoon. Two American men are touring Europe, and are scheduled to arrive in France Sunday afternoon. However, they arrived several hours early, and had little to do on Sunday morning while everything was closed.Well, one says to the other, pointing to a nearby Cathedral, why don't we attend Mass?Sure, replies his friend. But we don't know how the French pray and we can't speak French!The first guy thinks of a solution. We'll pick a guy in front of us, and whatever he does, we'll do.His friend agrees. They enter the church, sit close to the front, and choose a guy.Fifteen minutes pass, and their plan is working well. Thirty minutes, no issues.By the time forty-five minutes pass, they've gotten used to the routine. Suddenly, while everyone is seated, the priest says something in French and the gentleman they chose stands up. Without thinking, the two Americans stand up as well.The church bursts into hard laughter.Realizing that no one else is standing up, the two American men leave in embarrassment. They wait for the Mass to end, and then approach the priest, who spoke English.We're well-meaning people- we don't speak French and just chose some guy to imitate while praying, one says.The priest chuckles. Ah.	You're probably wondering why everyone laughed at you.Yes, replied the other American.Well, you see, I announced the Baptism of a child... and asked for the father of the child to stand up.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Edited to add: **thank you** to the kind stranger who gave me my first silver!

A perfectly triangular lake has 3 kingdoms on its 3 sides. . The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.	And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

I had spent the whole winter sitting in a damp basement in front of a computer and was probably a bit rusty.The party's heating up and this blonde girl notices me standing there and walks over to me.She had already taken her jacket off and was just wearing a tank top.

The man's wife, inside the house, heard the conversation and said to her husband, Does she realize that the porch goes all the way around the house?The man replied, She should.

And best of all, we can play football all we want, and we never get tired.That's fantastic, says Mike. It's beyond my wildest dreams!

So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living. He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said, Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just a bad conductor.

Donald Trump was visiting a primary school and he visited one of the classes. They were in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings. The teacher asked the President if he would like to lead the discussion on the word tragedy. So the illustrious leader asked the class for an example of a tragedy. One little boy stood up and offered: If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs over him and kills him, that would be a tragedy. No, said Trump, that would be an accident A little girl raised her hand: If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy. I’m afraid not, explained the president. That’s what we would call great loss. The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Trump searched the room. Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? Finally at the back of the room a small boy raised his hand... In a quiet voice he said: If ‘Air Force One’ was carrying you and was struck by a friendly fire missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy. Fantastic! exclaimed Trump. That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be tragedy?	Well, said the boy, It has to be a tragedy, because it certainly wouldn’t be a great loss, and it probably wouldn’t be a fucking accident either.
A perfectly triangular lake has 3 kingdoms on its 3 sides. . The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.	And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

I took my daughter out for her first drink... While reading an article about fathers and sons drinking together, I remembered the time I took my daughter out for her first drink. Off we went to our local bar only two blocks from the house. I got her a Guinness. She didn't like it, so I drank it. Then I got her a Killian's she didn't like that either, so I drank it. Finally, I thought she might like some Harp Lager? She didn't. I drank it. I thought maybe she'd like whiskey better than beer so we tried a Jameson's; nope! In desperation, I had her try that 25 year old Glenfiddich. The bar's finest scotch. She wouldn't even smell it. What could I do but drink it! By the time I realized she just didn't like to drink, I was so shit-faced I could hardly push her stroller back home!!!	~  ~  *[edit: Thank you for the gold, kind stranger.]

He demanded to speak with Satan.Why do you have this man when he lived righteously and has a place in heaven?	God bellowed.I don't know, but I'm keeping him, Satan snarkily replied.You will hand him over now, God said ferociously, or else I will sue you!Satan smirked.Where you gonna get a lawyer?

Balls.. A big Texan stopped at a local restaurant following a day roaming around in Mexico. While sipping his tequila, he noticed a sizzling, scrumptious looking platter being served at the next table. Not only did it look good, but the smell was wonderful. He asked the waiter, What is that you just served? The waiter replied, Ah, Señor, you have excellent taste! Those are called Cojones de Toro, bull's testicles from the bull fight this morning. A real delicacy! The cowboy said, What the heck, bring me an order. The waiter replied, I am so sorry, Señor. There is only one serving per day because there is only one bull fight each morning. If you come early and place your order, we will be sure to save you this delicacy. The next morning, the cowboy returned, placed hisorder, and that evening was served the one and only special delicacy of the day. After a few bites, inspecting his platter, he called to the waiter and said, These are delicious, but they are much, much smaller than the ones I saw you serve yesterday. The waiter shrugged his shoulders and replied, Si, Señor.	Sometimes the bull wins.

[Serious] Just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive. A few days ago I was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.Here's the joke I told:What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.Obviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown?No, replied the guy.	He choked on a sock.

The Jones didn't have any children and decided to use a proxy father to start their family. On the day the proxy father was to arrive, Mr. Jones kissed his wife and said, I'm off, honey. The man should be here soon. Half an hour later, a door-to-door baby photographer rang the doorbell with the hopes of making a sale.Good morning madam. You don't know me but I've come to.....Oh, there's no need to explain. I've been expecting you, Mrs. Jones cut in.You have? the photographer asked. Well, good! I've made a specialty of babies.That's exactly what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat. Just where do we start? asked a blushing Mrs. Jones.You just leave everything to me, he replied. Usually, I try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. Sometimes the living room floor is fun too; you can really spread out.Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work for George and me, stated Mrs. Jones.Well, madam, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. However, if we try several different positions, and I shoot from five or six angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.I certainly hope we can get this over with quickly, gasped Mrs. Jones.Madam, in my line of work, a man must take his time. I would love to be in and out in five minutes, but you'd be disappointed with that, I'm sure.Don't I know! exclaimed Mrs. Jones.The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. This was done on the top of a bus in the downtown area, he proudly declared.Oh my word! Mrs. Jones exclaimed.And these twins turned out exceptionally well, considering the fact that their mother was so difficult to work with, he said, handing Mrs. Jones the photograph.She was difficult? Mrs. Jones asked.Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to Central Park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep, pushing and shoving to get a good look.Four and five deep? asked Mrs. Jones, her eyes the size of saucers.Yes, said the photographer. And for more than three hours too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling. It was very difficult for me to concentrate. Then darkness approached and I began to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just packed it all in.You mean they actually chewed on your, umm, equipment? Mrs. Jones asked.That's right. Well madam, if you're ready, I'll set up my tripod so that we can get to work.Tripod? asked a very worried Mrs. Jones.Oh yes, I have to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much too big for me to hold while I'm getting ready for action.Madam, madam?	Good Lord, she's fainted!

One day a man hears that a distant uncle passed away. He's a little sad, but only a little, for they barely knew each other. Then, a few days later, a package arrives. It contains his inheritance from the estate: A violin and a painting. He has no idea what to do with them. After pondering the matter, he takes them to an appraiser. Not too long later the appraiser calls him: I've finished my analysis, and I've got some good news. There's no doubt at all that what you have is a genuine Van Gogh and a genuine Stradivarius. The man is ecstatic: I can sell these for millions! The appraiser says Well, you can sell them, and they'll fetch some money for their novelty value. But not millions.	You see, the truth is, Stradivarius wasn't much of a painter... and Van Gogh made lousy violins.

A gorilla walks into a bar. A gorilla goes into a bar and orders a martini. This totally amazes the bartender, but he thinks, What the heck, I guess I might as well make the drink. So he mixes the martini. He then walks back over to the give it to the gorilla, and the animal is holding out a twenty-dollar bill. Well, now the bartender is just at a loss for words. He can't believe that a gorilla walked into his bar, ordered a martini, and then actually had a twenty-dollar bill to pay for it. So, in amazement, he takes the twenty and walks to the cash register to make the change. While he's standing in front of the cash register he stops for a second and thinks to himself, Let me try something here and see if the gorilla notices anything.

So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living. He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said, Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just a bad conductor.

Scarlett Johansson asked, Nothing... the guy would say...She pestered him for a while eventually saying she would do ANYTHING he needed or wanted to make him feel good again, just because she really cared for him a lot, and even if he wasn't asking, she felt it was the least she owed it to him...Really?, you'll do anything I'd like?yes she said anything!ok, first i want you to take off you toga and get into this pair of work jeans that somehow washed on the shoreok...now put this shirt on please, but first, tape your boobs so they are flatwha... ok, I'd say I'd do anything she said lovingly.ok, now, take this hat and wear it, but tuck your hair under itShe was kinda confused, but non the less, she wanted to make him happy, so she tucked her hair under the hat.Now id like for you to grab this piece of soot and paint yourself a beard and a mustacheok... if this is what you want... she muttered.now, please, put on these sunglasses, and start walking down the beach I'll catch up to you in a bit, he said a bit excited...She started walking... wondering... doubting herself... just confused about what had just happened, maybe it wasn't her, maybe it was h... suddenly the guy grabs her by her shoulder turns her around and says: DUDE!!!	you won't believe who I've been fucking for the past 6 months!

An engineer dies and is sent to hell. He's hot and miserable, so he decides to take action. The A/C has been busted for a long time, so he fixes it. Things cool down quickly. The moving walkway motor jammed, so he un-jams it. People can get from place to place more easily. The TV was grainy and unclear, so he fixes the connection to the Satellite dish and now they get hundreds of high def channels. One day, God decides to look down on Hell to see how his grand design is working out and notices that everyone is happy and enjoying umbrella drinks. He asks the Devil what's up? The Devil says, Things are great down here since you sent us an engineer. What? says God. An engineer? I didn't send you one of those. That must have been a mistake. Send him upstairs immediately. The Devil responds, No way. We want to keep our engineer. We like him. God demands, If you don't send him to me immediately, I'll sue! The Devil laughs.	Where are YOU going to get a lawyer?

Donald Trump was visiting a primary school and he visited one of the classes. They were in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings. The teacher asked the President if he would like to lead the discussion on the word tragedy. So the illustrious leader asked the class for an example of a tragedy. One little boy stood up and offered: If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs over him and kills him, that would be a tragedy. No, said Trump, that would be an accident A little girl raised her hand: If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy. I’m afraid not, explained the president. That’s what we would call great loss. The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Trump searched the room. Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? Finally at the back of the room a small boy raised his hand... In a quiet voice he said: If ‘Air Force One’ was carrying you and was struck by a friendly fire missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy. Fantastic! exclaimed Trump. That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be tragedy?	Well, said the boy, It has to be a tragedy, because it certainly wouldn’t be a great loss, and it probably wouldn’t be a fucking accident either.

A man goes to heaven, and to his surprise, he sees a huge wall covered in clocks. A man goes to heaven, and after walking through the gates, he gets escorted to a waiting room. In the room, he sees a huge wall, covered in clocks. Each clock has only one hand, and each hand has a name written on it. Some clocks are moving rather slowly, while others go a full circle in less than ten seconds. The man asks one of the angels there about the strange wall. The angel responds:Each clock in this room represents a country back on Earth. You see, each clock has the country's name written on the hand, and each time a person from that country commits a sinful act, the hand on said clock goes forward a bit. The bigger the country the bigger the clock.Intrigued by this, the man seeks out the clock of his own country, Canada. And what do you know, there it is, going forward one step at a time. He looks at all the other clocks, like Russia, the biggest if them all. Right next to Russia is tiny Estonia, and next to that Finland, Sweden and Norway, all going steadily forward, almost simultaneously.But one clock is missing. The man asks the angel, Where is the American clock? I thought it would be pretty big, but I can't see it anywhere.The angel responds:Ah yes, that one. An arrangement was made to have that one transferred to hell.The man asks:Huh? Why is that?	To which the angel responds:It's being used as the ceiling fan in the smoking room.

I couldn't serve you half a beer even if I wanted to.But that's not a problem mathematician #3 chimes in at the end of the joke you serve us a whole number of beers.

An engineer dies and is sent to hell. He's hot and miserable, so he decides to take action. The A/C has been busted for a long time, so he fixes it. Things cool down quickly. The moving walkway motor jammed, so he un-jams it. People can get from place to place more easily.

One day, God decides to look down on Hell to see how his grand design is working out and notices that everyone is happy and enjoying umbrella drinks. He asks the Devil what's up? The Devil says, Things are great down here since you sent us an engineer. What? says God. An engineer? I didn't send you one of those. That must have been a mistake. Send him upstairs immediately. The Devil responds, No way. We want to keep our engineer. We like him. God demands, If you don't send him to me immediately, I'll sue! The Devil laughs.	Where are YOU going to get a lawyer?

Two Aliens. Two aliens landed in the Arizona desert near a gas station that was closed for the night. They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien addressed it saying, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.The gas pump, of course, didn't respond.The younger alien became angry at the lack of response.The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you. 'The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response. Pissed at  the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said gruffly, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader or I will fire!The older alien again warned his comrade saying,  'You probably don't want to do that! I really think that will make him mad. ''Rubbish,' replied the cocky, young alien. He aimed his weapon  and opened fire. There was a huge explosion. A massive fireball roared towards him and blew the younger alien off his feet and threw him in a burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch.Half an hour passed. When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head.

Three men, Joe, Bro, and Buddy, all lived in a small town. One day, Joe went hunting alone, and for the next few days no one heard from him. About a week afterwards, a body was found and brought into the coroner’s office. The coroner, after thoroughly examining the body, needed a positive identification in order to verify that the body was indeed Joe. So, he brought in Bro and Buddy, and told them to come in separately to identify the body. Bro came in first, and was asked to look for any details about the body that he recognized. After a few minutes of examining, Bro said, Mr. Coroner, I’ll need you to turn the body over for me to be sure.Confused, the coroner obliged. Bro continued to examine the body, bent down on one knee, reared his head sideways, then stood up and said, No sir, this can’t be Joe.The coroner was even more confused, but he accepted this statement and sent Bro out. Next, he invited Buddy in to repeat the task. Buddy, after examining the body in a similar fashion to Bro, also requested that the body be turned over.The coroner, after mumbling a bit about his confusion, flipped the body over. Buddy too bent down on one knee and examined the back area of the body, then, just as Bro had previously, said, No sir, Mr. Coroner, this isn’t Joe.The coroner was astonished, so he asked that Bro come back in so that the two of them were standing there at once. The coroner said, Gentlemen, this man’s dental records and features match perfectly with those of your friend Joe’s. How on earth are you both positive this isn’t him?Bro and Buddy looked at each other, then Bro answered, Sir, this can’t be Joe because Joe has two assholes.In shock, the coroner asked, How can he have two assholes? Have you ever seen them?Buddy replied, No sir, but it was common knowledge. Every time we were out with him, people would say, ‘Look, it’s Joe with those two assholes!’**Credit goes to my grandmother, who was the first to tell me this joke.	**

Once upon a time there lived a ravishing Queen with huge tits.. Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear.	The King immediately summoned Nick.

A new twist on an old joke. Scientists recently did a study on the effects the right side and left side of a brain had on counting.They first took out the left half of a man's brain and asked him to count to 10. He says, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.They put the left half back in and removed the right half, asking him to count to 10 again. He says 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.Finally they decided to just go for it and removed the whole brain. They again asked him to count to 10 one more time.He says, Look. I'm great at counting to 10, ok? I love numbers and I have the best numbers. No one has better numbers than I do. My 4th grade math teacher - and let me tell you, she was the best and smartest math teacher in the country at the time - my 4th grade math teacher said to me that I am the best counter she's ever seen. The best. So if you want me to count to 10, let me tell you I can count to 10 alright. That's no problem. I will do it. I will.	And I will do it better than any has ever done it before, ok?

A priest told me this joke as a kid. There were 3 men, they were best friends, and they were quite unhealthy. Their names were, Bert, Chester, and Earl.They were actually really unhealthy and Bert decided that he needed to take charge of him and his friends' health. He decided that they were going to be on a diet together to help them live for as long as possible. He broke the news to his friends, and they weren't too happy about it, but they decided to go along with it anyways, because they knew how out-of-shape they all were. It was tough for them all to stick to the plan at times, however they got through it together. They each lost between 120-140 pounds over the course of 20 years and were in amazing shape for their age.One day the 3 of them were given great news.Bert got a call, he answered it, then turned around to everyone and said: Guys! My daughter just had a child! I'm going to be a grandpa!. Everybody was celebrating for Bert when Earl got a call from his son. He answered it, and turned around to everybody and said:Guys! My son is going to get married today! I'm so excited!. Everybody was now celebrating for Bert and Earl, when Chester got a call. He answered it, turned around and said to everybody: Guys! My family is having a reunion today! I'm going to see so many people that I haven't seen in years!.They found out that the wedding, hospital, and park where the reunion was were all in the same town, and decided to carpool together to get there. It had snowed a little the day before and the roads were a little icy. As they were getting onto the highway, their car slipped and ran into a semi-truck. It killed all three of them.The three of them wake up together in heaven. They notice an angel standing over them and one of them asks Where are we?. The angels says: Congratulations, you made it to heaven. The angel decides to show them around the place and starts at a banquet. Here is a banquet for you three to enjoy, you've earned it. Chester looks a little sad, and Earl notices and asks him, What's wrong?. Chester finally speaks up, Okay, this is so nice of you to put together, but we're on a diet. I wouldn't want to overdo my calorie intake for the day. The angle replies to them, No worries, you can have as much food as you like without worrying about it. The guys are elated by that news, when the angel decides to show them another place.Next, the angel decides to show them a place where they can spend time having fun. He shows them to a massive building with games everywhere you look. There are at least 50 pool tables, 30 bowling alley lanes, people are playing poker, there are arcade games everywhere, and tons of people enjoying themselves. He tells them,This is where you may spend much of your time, if you choose. Many people enjoy it here and you might find some new friends. The guys really like this room, but Earl notices that Chester is looking sad again. Earls asks him,What's wrong?. Chester responds with,My wife left me because of my gambling problems, I don't want to disappoint anyone else because of it. I'm afraid I wont be able to enjoy this area. The angel then slightly irritated lets him know,Don't you see? There are no problems here. You don't have to worry about gambling issues, because money isn't an issue here. Chester is especially happy to hear that news, and the angel decides to show them where they are going to live.The angel finally takes them to the third place, and it is a huge mansion. The guys are led inside, when the angel says, This is where you three can live, if you choose to. Otherwise we have some other mansions, if you want to live alone. The guys are very intrigued by the house, they notice a big window on a wall with an amazing view. They could see for at least 5 miles clearly. They all can't help but gasp when looking through the window. Earl can't help but be concerned about this place. He decides to ask, So, uh... What's the rent here?. The angel looks back at them with an irritated glare are replies Nothing? It's free. Earl is sure to thank the angel and says,Wow! That's so kind of you guys!. Bert notices that Chester is looking a little sad. Bert says,What's wrong Chester? Isn't it amazing here?. Chester looks up, looks Bert in the eye and says a little mad, If it weren't for your goddamn diet. Bert.	We could've been here 20 years ago!.

A husband notices his wife’s hearing is deteriorating and decides to visit her doctor for advice. I can’t speak to my wife directly as she might find it offensive, given our old age he says to the doc. There’s a simple trick you can try to determine her hearing explains the doctor. Simply ask her a question at a distance and if she doesn’t hear you, move slightly closer and ask again until she does. That night, the husband arrives home and sees his wife in the kitchen cooking. He thinks to himself, what a perfect opportunity to test her hearing. He stands in the doorway of the kitchen and promptly asks;What’s for dinner honey?No answer. He moves closer. What’s for dinner honey?Still no answer. He moves even closer. What’s for dinner honey?Still his wife doesn’t answer. He now sees how serious her hearing problem is. At this point, he is stood right next to his wife.	What’s for dinner honey?FOR THE FOURTH FUCKING TIME WE’RE HAVING CHICKEN

A married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine that would transfer a portion of the mother's labor pain to the father. He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it.The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine.The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him.

An Arab family was considering putting their grandfather Abdullah in a nursing home. All  the Arab Facilities were completely full, so they had to put him in an Italian home.After  a few weeks in the Italian facility, they came to visit Abdullah. How  do you like it here? Asked the grandson.It's  wonderful! Everyone here is so courteous and respectful, said Abdullah.We're  so happy for you. We were worried that this was the wrong place for you since you are a little different from everyone.Oh,  no! Let me tell you about how wonderfully they treat the residents. Abdullah said with a big smile. There's  a musician here - he's  85 years old. He hasn't played the violin in 20 years and everyone still calls him Maestro! There  is a judge in here - he's 95 year old. He hasn't been on the bench in 30 years and everyone still calls him Your Honour. There's  a dentist here - 90 years old. He hasn't fixed a tooth for 25 years, and everyone still calls him Doctor.	And  me - I haven't had sex for 35 years and they still call me the Fucking Arab.

What is the best Donald Trump joke you've heard? Don’t know if this one is in here yet, but here goes:Trump is visiting a class in an elementary school where they are talking about words and meanings. The teacher asks Trump if he would like to lead the class in a discussion of the word tragedy. (No, not the punch line yet)So he asks the class for an example of a tragedy. One little boy stands up and offers, if my best friend who lives on a farm is playing in a field and a runaway tractor comes along and knocks him dead, that’d be a tragedy.Not quite, says Mr. Trump, that would be an accident.A little girl raises her hand: if a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.I’m afraid not, explained the president. That’s what we would call a great loss.The room goes silent. Trump searches the room. Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? Finally at the back of the room, little Johnny raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says, If Air Force One, carrying you was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens; that would be a tragedy.Fantastic! exclaimed Mr. Trump. That’s right.	And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?Well’, said little Johnny, because it sure as hell wouldn’t be a great loss and probably wouldn’t be an accident either.

This guy seems tougher then he looks, I better leave while I can.Over by the tree top, a monkey witnessed everything. Evidently, the monkey realizes the he can benefit from this situation by telling the lion and getting something in return. So the monkey proceeds to tell the lion what really happened and the lion says angrily get on my back, we'll get him together.So they start rushing back to the dog.

Three years ago I mistakenly bought my son a giant conch shell…. I have a son who’s on the spectrum. It’s quite common for people like him to latch onto one specific topic and become an absolute encyclopedia about it. Some people choose trains, some a cartoon. For my son, this was mollusks. Interesting topic I know, but it seemed to be a pretty good deal for us because it meant he’d get really excited about going outside to the beach which we figured was healthier than staying inside all the time. He’d always have a shell with him, or in his pocket. Usually he doesn’t want to talk much, but if you opened the conversation to it, he’d sit there rattling off facts about mollusks for hours. This was shaping up to be a long term passion, so for his 15th birthday I went out and bought him a giant conch shell. He absolutely loved it. The texture, holding it to his ear etc. It was too big to carry around with him all the time, but he kept it by his bed. Fast forward three years, this is where things get weird. About a month ago I was cleaning his room and picked up the conch to dust it off, something I’ve never actually done before. I was immediately hit by a terrible smell – I don’t want to get too into the gross details but I’m a dude, a once 18 year old dude, so I know what happens when you use something to masturbate and don’t clean it. I’m sure we all know what that smells like even after a week. It was pretty clear he had been using this shell as a kind of Strombidae fleshlight for a long, long time without cleaning it. I’m not going to share too much about what happened when this all came to light, but we tried taking it away and my god you’d think we just took his whole world. We decided to give the shell back, but worried this reflected a deeper issue my partner and I decided to get some professional help. So it’s been about a month of him seeing a behavioural therapist, and she recently asked me about his progress at home. I told her it’s been incredibly promising so far.	He’s really starting to come out of his shell.

May I ask you a question?	Why did you take the quarters instead of the dollar bill?’ The boy licked his cone and replied, ‘Because the day I take the dollar, the game is over!’

The American laughs, buys the 10 shots for the Irish man and shows him the cash. Quickly the Irishman slams all 10 shots with ease. Astondished, but a man of his word the American gives the Irish man the $1,000 and says, I just have one question, where the hell did you go?

Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam. His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. What happened? he asked, exasperated.The old monk shook his head sadly. Isn't it obvious? he said. Sam sung Note 7.- EDIT - Wow, I came back and this really blew up! Thanks so much for the kind comments, and upvotes, and gold.	I'm so glad I could give so many people a chuckle today!
Tell the Punchline first. 	How do you ruin a joke?
4 years ago today, I shared the worst joke I ever created. Here it is again for those that missed it. There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted. About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off. The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak. The grim reaper swears. Oh no! This always happens with identical twins. What do you mean? asks the dentist. Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now. The dentist is noticeably upset. He says Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life. The grim reaper asks What do you have in mind? The dentist thinks. How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free. The grim reaper laughs. I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose? The dentist smiles. I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide. Very well says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom. Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance. The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles. It's unbelievable. The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth. The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. You win, human. This time. Your brother will live. He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died. The dentist smiles on the phone and says. That's interesting, bro.	Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.

However, a few minutes later, he knocks on the front door.I'm sorry, but there is a cow in the barn, and they are sacred to me.No problem, says the Rabbi, and he goes to the barn. Again though, he returns and knocks. There is also a pig in there, and that is against our teachings.I will go then, friends, says the Jehovah's Witness, and he proceeds to the barn.

A professional gambler wins big and dies of an aneurysm. When he gets to the afterlife, he finds himself at the back of a miles-long line to get into Heaven.Drawing on his experience, the gambler immediately thinks of a way to get ahead of everyone else. He taps the old man ahead of him on the shoulder...Want to make a bet while we wait? The Gambler asks. If I can guess your last words in three tries, you have to let me cut ahead of you.The old man, having nothing better to do, agrees. Immediately, the gambler begins reading him like the pro player he is. He notices the elderly Asian man's shirt is open, exposing a pair of defibrillator marks.Don't be silly, it's just indigestion. the gambler remarks. The old man looks a bit surprised, then steps aside, giving up his place in line.Next, the gambler taps on a redneck's shoulder. He makes the same bet, and the redneck also accepts.This one's easy! the gambler smirks, sizing up the bruised, bloody, grass stained redneck with the caved in skull. Hold my beer!Muttering profanities, the redneck begrudgingly steps aside and gives up his place in line.Riding the high of a hot streak, the gambler wastes no time tapping the next man ahead of him on the shoulder. He quickly makes the same bet, and is ecstatic when the agreement is made.Okay, let's see... The gambler studies the new mark carefully. He's a large, imposing black man riddled with several bullet holes.The gambler holds his hand out like a gun. You ain't taking me alive!The man shakes his head. Wrong. The gambler strokes his chin. The guy is giving him nothing else to work with.The gambler holds the 'gun' sideways, makes a mean face, and shouts, Fuck the police!Wrong again. The gambler's getting frustrated, now. He's never been unable to read someone before.Finally, the gambler throws his hands in the air. I'VE GOT NOTHING! He shouts.	I GIVE UP!The man steps aside.

There was this tramp. One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.Coincidentally the father drives up. How can I ever thank you sir? he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.Ah, well... stammers the tramp, ... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.Oh dear, says the father, I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.No! No! says the tramp, Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.Ten pounds, thinks the tramp, I'm rich! I'm rich! and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. I'll have one holiday please!Ahem, which holiday would sir like? asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds, replies the tramp.TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds, says the girl incredulously.She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.Well you'll never believe it, she says to the tramp, back in the shop. I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.Yippee! exclaims the tramp, I'll take it!A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.Get off my ship ye dirty bum! shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.But I've got my ticket!, responds the tramp, super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!Well okay, says the captain, but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.Psst, says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6 pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3 deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.Sheer luxury! exclaimed the tramp, A room of my very own.I'm glad you like it, replies the captain, but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what a dive...!Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.That was amazing! exclaimed the captain, Where did you learn to dive like that?Um, well I've never actually dived before, replied the tramp.Well that's incredible! says the captain, I've never seen... He broke off. Hey, I've got an idea, he started again. How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!It's a deal! says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.Then one morning the captain comes to talk. Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.Okay, agreed the tramp.Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.Well, tramp, said the captain, shaking his hand, Let's see what you can do. And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...up and up...below him the ship grew smaller...on and on...past a solitary albatross...and still higher...till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...and on still further.../ till the ocean grew dim...and the earth itself...began to shrink...past our moon...and on...and Mars...and on...higher, and higher...through the asteroid belt...and on and on towards the diving board...past the outer planets, until...on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...he reached the board.He climbed on top and radioed the captain...and then....' '.. .. .he jumped.....:Slowly at first,:but speeding up,:::faster, and faster,:speeding past Pluto,:and the other outer planets,.........through the asteroid belt,past Mars,and the moon,faster,and faster,faster - ever faster,and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,faster, and faster,past the albatross,double-back somersault,and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,I CAN SEE HIM! yelled a passenger, LOOK!! !The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!DOWN!DOWN!THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!STILL DOWN...!DEEPER,DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,TILL.........SMASH!Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.Up and up, desperate, gasping...Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.HERO! WONDERFUL! AMAZING! GOOD SHOW THAT!And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.The tramp blushed.The captain went on, but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: Well you see...For me to tell you, I'll need $49.95The captain outrageously asked why.The tramp said The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes, As for cost, we selected initial values based upon data from the Open Beta and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch.

This is the dirty joke my 85yo grandad told to our whole family by memory. A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship. The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink. They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore. At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him.	Look, she said, I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.

A perfectly triangular lake has 3 kingdoms on its 3 sides. . The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.	And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up. So, he opens the box and picks up the letter. He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters. When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail. He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it. The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter. *Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, Ding-dong. *The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.Pardon me, sir, the mailman says, but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.Ah, my letter. Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated. Please do so again replies the Buddhist monk.But sir, says mailman, you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.But that is my intention, dear man, replies the Buddhist monk.	You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.

Then we'll talk about the car The boy thought about that for a moment, decided he'd settle for the offer and they agreed on it.After about six weeks his father said, Son, you've brought your grades up and I've observed that you have been studying your Bible, but I'm disappointed you haven't had your hair cut.	The boy said, You know, Dad, I've been thinking about that, and I've noticed in my studies of the Bible that Samson had long hair, John the Baptist had long hair, Moses had long hair, and there's even strong evidence that Jesus had long hair.The father responded, Did you also notice that they all walked everywhere they went?

An elderly woman walked into the Royal Bank of Ireland one morning with a purse full of money.  She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money. After many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office. The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'. The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money . The elderly woman replied that she made bets. The president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?' The elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.' The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that. The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?' 'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.' 'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.' 'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently. That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that way, up and down, turned it around, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet. The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square  The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly. The president was happy to oblige. The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.' The elderly woman did so with a little smile.	Suddenly the president noticed that the \*lawyer was banging his head against the wall.\*  He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, 'Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock this morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Royal Bank of Ireland '

There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living... There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.The man was perfectly fine.Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just a bad conductor.

You're the only white man we've ever seen and this woman gives birth to a white child. It doesn't take a genius to figure out what happened!The professor replied, No, Chief. You're mistaken. What you have here is a natural occurrence, what we in the civilized world call an albino! Look at that field over there. All of the sheep are white except for one black one. Nature does this on occasion.The chief was silent for a moment, then said, Tell you what.	You don't say anything more about that sheep and I won't say anything more about that white child.

A guy was walking down the street when he sees a woman with perfect breasts. He says to her, Hey, miss, would you let me bite your breasts for $100? Are you nuts? she replies and walks away.He turns around, runs around the block and gets to the corner before she does. Would you let me bite your breasts for $1,000? he asks again. Listen, sir, I'm not that kind of woman. Got it?So the guy runs around the next block and faces her again. Would you let me bite your breasts... just once for $10,000? So the woman thinks about this for a while and says, Hmmmmm, $10,000? She thinks a bit OK, but just once, and not here. Let's go to that dark alley over there.So they go to the alley and she takes off... her blouse to reveal the most perfect breasts in the world.

I was a big metal fan back in high school. Back in high school I was a big metal fan. At the beginning of the summer holidays I was at this awesome house party.It was just high school kids in the house so we were able to turn the volume way up and had a pretty awesome playlist: Metallica, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden ... and probably quite a few more.As the night went on people are getting drunker and drunker and a few even disappear upstairs to hook up.I was standing in the corner by myself not really interacting with anyone else. I had spent the whole winter sitting in a damp basement in front of a computer and was probably a bit rusty.The party's heating up and this blonde girl notices me standing there and walks over to me.She had already taken her jacket off and was just wearing a tank top. This girl looked super hot.She smiles and runs her hand over me. My pole was seriously hard.Then she kneels down in front of me and as you can imagine I was already turned on at this point.She's pushing all my buttons and my head is spinning.	It's not long before I blow all over her face and chest.Her boyfriend is right in the next room, she hadn't closed the door and he just saw the whole thing.He walks up to us, looking really hot under the collar.He gets right up in my face and she backs away, but she accidentally trips over my extension chord because I was a ... big ... metal ... fan.

A gambler dies and goes to Heaven... A professional gambler wins big and dies of an aneurysm. When he gets to the afterlife, he finds himself at the back of a miles-long line to get into Heaven.Drawing on his experience, the gambler immediately thinks of a way to get ahead of everyone else. He taps the old man ahead of him on the shoulder...Want to make a bet while we wait? The Gambler asks. If I can guess your last words in three tries, you have to let me cut ahead of you.The old man, having nothing better to do, agrees. Immediately, the gambler begins reading him like the pro player he is. He notices the elderly Asian man's shirt is open, exposing a pair of defibrillator marks.Don't be silly, it's just indigestion. the gambler remarks. The old man looks a bit surprised, then steps aside, giving up his place in line.Next, the gambler taps on a redneck's shoulder. He makes the same bet, and the redneck also accepts.This one's easy! the gambler smirks, sizing up the bruised, bloody, grass stained redneck with the caved in skull. Hold my beer!Muttering profanities, the redneck begrudgingly steps aside and gives up his place in line.Riding the high of a hot streak, the gambler wastes no time tapping the next man ahead of him on the shoulder. He quickly makes the same bet, and is ecstatic when the agreement is made.Okay, let's see... The gambler studies the new mark carefully. He's a large, imposing black man riddled with several bullet holes.The gambler holds his hand out like a gun. You ain't taking me alive!The man shakes his head. Wrong. The gambler strokes his chin. The guy is giving him nothing else to work with.The gambler holds the 'gun' sideways, makes a mean face, and shouts, Fuck the police!Wrong again. The gambler's getting frustrated, now. He's never been unable to read someone before.Finally, the gambler throws his hands in the air. I'VE GOT NOTHING! He shouts.	I GIVE UP!The man steps aside.

I speak blonde.He goes back to the blonde and whispers in her ear, and she says, Oh, I’m sorry and gets up and goes back to her seat in economy.The flight attendant and co-pilot are amazed and asked him what he said to make her move without any fuss.I told her, First class isn’t going to Sydney

Oh, how nice (A joke from my 96 year old great-grandmother-in-law) Two women are in the hospital. Their labor has started, but not progressed enough for delivery, so they are in a room waiting together.Is this your first child? says the older woman.No, says the younger woman. I have another.I have three. Continues the older woman. After the first kid, my husband was so sweet. He bought me a diamond necklace.Oh, how nice. Said the young woman.After the second, he bought me a new car. He said I deserve the best.Oh, how nice. Said the younger woman.And after the third, he bought us a new house. It was expensive, but he said his family was worth it.Oh, how nice. Said the younger woman.So, what has your husband gotten you?Well, we only have one child. After he was born, my husband thought I needed to clean up my language, so he got me lessons at charm school.Is that so?Yes.	Now instead of saying 'go fuck yourself,' I say 'oh, how nice'.

A policeman was interrogating 3 guys who were training to become detectives. To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first guys a picture for 5 seconds and then hides it. This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?The first guy answers, That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye! The policeman says, Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile.Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?The second guy smiles, flips his hair, and says, Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!The policeman angrily responds, What's the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, This is your suspect, how would you recognize him? He quickly adds, Think hard before giving me a stupid answer.The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, the suspect wears contact lenses.The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not. Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that. He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?That's easy, the third guy replied.	He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear.
As a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: 5 lamb chops, please.  Amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop. He follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and trot across the road to a bus-stop. The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench. When a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus. The butcher follows, dumbstruck. As the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery. After awhile he stands on his back paws to push the stop bell, then the butcher follows him off. The dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step. He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door. He does this again and again. No answer. So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window, jumps off, and waits at the front door. A big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog. The butcher runs up and screams at the guy: What the hell are you doing? This dog's a genius! The owner responds, Genius, my ass.........	It's the second time this week he's forgotten his keys!

Dear, Dad.It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you.I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.I've been finding real passion with Stacy.She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes and because she is so much older than I am.But it's not only the passion, Dad.She's pregnant.Stacy said that we will be very happy.She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter.We share a dream of having many more children.Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone.We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better.She sure deserves it!Don't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself.Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.Love, your son, Joshua.P.S.	Dad, none of the above is true.I'm over at Jason's house.I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that's on the kitchen table.Call when it is safe for me to come home!

Unbutton my blouse.. A successful rancher died and left everything to his devoted wife. She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand... Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk. She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.. For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well. Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels. The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night. One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return. Two o'clock and no hired hand. Finally he returned around two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him. She quietly called him over to her.. Unbutton my blouse and take it off, she said. Trembling, he did as she directed. Now take off my boots. He did as she asked, ever so slowly.. Now take off my socks. He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots. Now take off my skirt. He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light. Now take off my bra.. Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.	Then she looked at him and said, If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired.

Quiero calcetines, said the man.Well, these shirts are on sale this week, declared the salesgirl.No, no quiero camisas. Quiero calcetines, repeated the man.I still don't know what you're trying to say. We have some fine pants on this rack, offered the salesgirl.No, no quiero pantalones. Quiero calcetines, insisted the man.These sweaters are top quality, the salesgirl probed.No, no quiero sueter. Quiero calcetines, said the man.Our undershirts are over here, fumbled the salesgirl, beginning to lose patience.No, no quiero camisetas. Quiero calcetines, the man repeated.As they passed the underwear counter, the man spotted a display of socks and happily grabbed a pair. Holding them up he proclaimed, Eso sí que es!Why didn't you just spell it in the first place?!	yelled the salesgirl.edit: [credit for the joke](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8c9cmw/a_mexican_man_who_spoke_no_english_went_into_a/

As a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: 5 lamb chops, please.  Amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop. He follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and trot across the road to a bus-stop. The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench. When a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus. The butcher follows, dumbstruck. As the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery. After awhile he stands on his back paws to push the stop bell, then the butcher follows him off. The dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step. He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door. He does this again and again. No answer. So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window, jumps off, and waits at the front door. A big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog. The butcher runs up and screams at the guy: What the hell are you doing? This dog's a genius! The owner responds, Genius, my ass.........	It's the second time this week he's forgotten his keys!

Man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.You're in the afterlife! he tells the man, But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.What are the odds? they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line. The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. Come, the beggar told him, I'll take you to the evening meal. So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line, and then he added, and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. What is it, he thought, that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here? That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.The beggar laughed jovially. I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in! Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. That's the line for the dragon meat, he said before turning to the next line, and that's the line for angeldust stew, then he paused, confused.What is it?	the man asked his old friend.The beggar replied, There appears to be no punchline.

So two aliens find their way to earth.  They land in the Arizona desert near a gas station that was closed for the night. They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien addressed it saying, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.The gas pump, of course, didn't respond.The younger alien became angry at the lack of response.The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you. 'The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response.Pissed at  the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said gruffly, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader or I will fire!The older alien again warned his comrade saying,  'You probably don't want to do that! I really think that will make him mad. ''Rubbish,' replied the cocky, young alien. He aimed his weapon  and opened fire. There was a huge explosion. A massive fireball roared towards him and blew the younger alien off his feet and threw him in a burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch.Half an hour passed. When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head. 'What a ferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien. 'He damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?	'The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, 'If there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you never mess with a guy who can loop his dick over his shoulder twice and then stick it in his ear.'
What starts with f and ends with k? A first-grade teacher, Ms. Brooks, was having trouble with one of her more precocious students. The teacher asked, Harry, what exactly is your problem?Harry answered, I'm too smart for the 1st grade. My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she! I think I should be in the 3rd grade, too!Ms. Brooks finally had enough; she took Harry to the principal's office. While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the situation to the principal. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave. She agreed.Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he happily agreed to take the test.Principal:  What is 3 x 3?Harry:  9.Principal:  What is 6 x 6?Harry:  36.And so it went with every question the principal thought a bright 3rd grader should know.The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, Y’know, I reckon Harry can go to the 3rd grade.But Ms. Brooks is still skeptical of the little bugger and says to the principal, Not so fast, let me ask him a few questions.The principal and Harry both agree. Ms. Brooks asks, What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?Harry, after a moment:  Legs.Ms. Brooks:  What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?The principal wondered why would she ask such a question!Harry replied:  Pockets. to the Principal’s great relief. Ms. Brooks:  What does a dog do that a man steps into?Harry:  Pants.By now, the principal is sitting forward with his mouth hanging open.Ms. Brooks:  What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?Now the principal's eyes open really wide and before he could intervene, Harry replied, Bubble gum.Ms. Brooks:  What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?Harry:  Shake hands.The principal is now trembling with apprehension as Ms. Brooks asks the last question.Ms.	Brooks:  What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' and indicates a great deal of heat and excitement?Harry: Firetruck.The principal breaths a huge sigh of relief and tells the teacher, Put the little bastard in 5th Grade; I got the last seven questions wrong myself.
Her: I'm leaving you because you're too cocky. 	Him: Close the door on your way back in.

An HR manager was knocked down (tragically) by a bus and was killed. Her soul arrived at the Pearly Gates, where St.Peter welcomed her. Before you get settled in he said, We have a little problem…you see, we’ve never had a HR manager make it this far before and we’re not really sure what to do with you.Oh, I see, said the woman, can’t you just let me in?Well, I’d like to, said St Peter, But I have higher orders. We’re instructed to let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you’d like to go for all eternity.Actually, I think I’d prefer heaven, said the woman. Sorry, we have rules… at which St. Peter put the HR manager into the downward bound elevator.As the doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times.They played a perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed a superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had a wonderful night telling jokes and dancing.Before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. Now it’s time to spend a day in heaven, he said.So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day’s end St. Peter returned. So, he said, You’ve spent a day in hell and you’ve spent a day in heaven. You must choose between the two.The woman thought for a second and replied: Well, heaven is certainly lovely, but I actually had a better time in hell. I choose Hell.Accordingly, St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her.I don’t understand, stuttered the HR manager, The other day I was here, and there was a golf course, and a country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had a wonderful happy time.	Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.The Devil simply looked at her and smiled, Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you’re staff.

Sales pitch. Bubba Joe's first military assignment was to a military induction center, and, because he was a good talker, they assigned him the duty of advising new recruits about the government benefits, especially the GI insurance to which they were entitled.Before long the Captain in charge of the induction center began noticing that Bubba was getting a 99 percent sign-up for the top GI insurance.This was odd, because it would cost these poor inductees nearly $30.00 per month more for their higher coverage than what the government was already granting.The Captain decided that he would sit in the back of the room and observe Bubba's sales pitch. Bubba Joe stood up before his latest group of inductees and stated, If you have the normal GI insurance and go to Iraq and are killed, the government pays your beneficiary $6,000. If you take out the supplemental GI insurance, which will cost you an additional $30.00 per month, the government pays your beneficiary $200,000.	Now, Bubba concluded, which bunch do you think they're gonna send into combat first?

An American soldier, serving in World War II, had just returned from several weeks of intense action on the German front lines. He had finally been granted R&R and was on a train bound for London. The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train, looking for an empty seat. The only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged lady and was being used by her little dog.The war weary soldier asked, Please, ma'am, may I sit in that seat? The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see my Little Fifi is using that seat? The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing the woman with the dog.Again he asked, Please, lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired. The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant.The soldier didnt say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.The woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your automobiles on the wrong side of the road.	And now, sir, you've thrown the wrong bitch out the window.
Donald Trump was visiting a primary school and he visited one of the classes. They were in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings. The teacher asked the President if he would like to lead the discussion on the word tragedy. So the illustrious leader asked the class for an example of a tragedy. One little boy stood up and offered: If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs over him and kills him, that would be a tragedy. No, said Trump, that would be an accident A little girl raised her hand: If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy. I’m afraid not, explained the president. That’s what we would call great loss. The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Trump searched the room. Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? Finally at the back of the room a small boy raised his hand... In a quiet voice he said: If ‘Air Force One’ was carrying you and was struck by a friendly fire missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy. Fantastic! exclaimed Trump. That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be tragedy?	Well, said the boy, It has to be a tragedy, because it certainly wouldn’t be a great loss, and it probably wouldn’t be a fucking accident either.

Three people die and appear before Buddha. Stunned by the divine presence before them, they lower their heads.-Raise your heads. You were humble in life and your deeds were praiseworthy. You have earned the right to a reincarnation of your choice. You have much to accomplish yet though.One of the people takes a step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled.-Benevolent Buddha, what more could I possibly do in my next life? I thought I lived and acted to the fullest. Because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve.-My work was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. Right now, the world I leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.-My connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.-I know all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that I ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation.The three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.-Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?-Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.-You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?-Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.-This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?-W-well, I don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.	(edit: obligatory editted thanks to the kind people who handed over silver & gold to my stupid joke

A guy walks into a restaurant with a full-grown ostrich behind him.  The waitress asks for their orders. The guy says, A hamburger, fries, and a coke, and turns to the ostrich, What's yours?I'll have the same, says the ostrich.A short time later the waitress returns with the order. That will be $18.40 please. The man reaches into his pocket and, without looking, pulls out the exact change for payment.The next day, the guy and the ostrich come again and the guy says, A hamburger, fries, and a coke.The ostrich says, I'll have the same.Again the guy reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. This becomes routine until one night they enter the restaurant and the waitress asks, The usual?No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato, and salad, says the guy.Me too, says the ostrich.The waitress brings the order and says, That will be $42.62.Once again the guy pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. The waitress can't hold back her curiosity any longer. Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?Well, says the guy, several years ago I was cleaning my attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it a genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.That's brilliant! says the waitress. Most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!That's right.	Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there, says the guy.The waitress asks, But, sir, what's with the ostrich?The guy sighs and answers, My second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who agrees with everything I say.

A Priest, a thief, a Jewish schoolboy and Irishman die in a car crash... They stand before Saint Peter at the gates of heaven. Saint Peter looks at them and appears confused. My children he says There has been a mistake, you were not supposed to die today. I will allow you one more chance at life as long as you promise to love out the rest of your existence free of sin.

The thief notices a woman walking with an expensive looking purse. Convinced that he had only imagined the gates of heaven he rushes and attempts to steal the purse and *POOF* he disappears. Realizing what just happened the others understand that they must truly live without sin. The Irishman looks to his left and sees a pub. One drink won't hurt he says as he orders a pint. He lifts the cup to his lips and *POOF* he disappears. The Jewish schoolboy looks down and sees a coin that fell from the vanishing Irishman's pocket.	He bends down to pick it up, fully aware that greed is a sin, and *POOF* the priest disappears.

One day in the future, Donald Trump has a heart-attack and dies. He immediately goes to Hell, where the devil is waiting for him. I don't know what to do here, says the devil.You are on my list, but I have no room for you. You definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I've got three folks here who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU decide who leaves.Donald thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room.In it, was Richard Nixon and a  large pool of water. Nixon kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed. Over, and over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. Such was his fate in  hell.No, Donald said. I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and it would ruin my hair. I don't think I could do that all day  long.The devil led him to the door of the next room. In it, was Ronald Reagan with a sledge-hammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that  hammer, time after time after time. No, this is no good; I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day, commented Donald.The devil opened a third door. Through it, Donald saw Bill Clinton, lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head, and his legs restrained in a spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.	Donald looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said, Yeah man, I can handle this.The devil smiled and said, Okay: Monica, you're free to go.

A man goes to heaven, and to his surprise, he sees a huge wall covered in clocks. A man goes to heaven, and after walking through the gates, he gets escorted to a waiting room. In the room, he sees a huge wall, covered in clocks. Each clock has only one hand, and each hand has a name written on it. Some clocks are moving rather slowly, while others go a full circle in less than ten seconds. The man asks one of the angels there about the strange wall. The angel responds:Each clock in this room represents a country back on Earth. You see, each clock has the country's name written on the hand, and each time a person from that country commits a sinful act, the hand on said clock goes forward a bit. The bigger the country the bigger the clock.Intrigued by this, the man seeks out the clock of his own country, Canada. And what do you know, there it is, going forward one step at a time. He looks at all the other clocks, like Russia, the biggest if them all. Right next to Russia is tiny Estonia, and next to that Finland, Sweden and Norway, all going steadily forward, almost simultaneously.But one clock is missing. The man asks the angel, Where is the American clock? I thought it would be pretty big, but I can't see it anywhere.The angel responds:Ah yes, that one. An arrangement was made to have that one transferred to hell.The man asks:Huh? Why is that?	To which the angel responds:It's being used as the ceiling fan in the smoking room.

A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?  The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.The man says, All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door.The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, Real funny.	May I have the key?The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.The man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk
What is the best Donald Trump joke you've heard? Don’t know if this one is in here yet, but here goes:Trump is visiting a class in an elementary school where they are talking about words and meanings. The teacher asks Trump if he would like to lead the class in a discussion of the word tragedy. (No, not the punch line yet)So he asks the class for an example of a tragedy. One little boy stands up and offers, if my best friend who lives on a farm is playing in a field and a runaway tractor comes along and knocks him dead, that’d be a tragedy.Not quite, says Mr. Trump, that would be an accident.A little girl raises her hand: if a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.I’m afraid not, explained the president. That’s what we would call a great loss.The room goes silent. Trump searches the room. Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? Finally at the back of the room, little Johnny raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says, If Air Force One, carrying you was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens; that would be a tragedy.Fantastic! exclaimed Mr. Trump. That’s right.	And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?Well’, said little Johnny, because it sure as hell wouldn’t be a great loss and probably wouldn’t be an accident either.

There's a little-known legend about Attila the Hun... The story goes that Attila used to collect exotic animals that he found during his conquests. He particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was a giant snake. He was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign.But his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet.Wishing to save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent.	Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.Curious, Attila did as he asked.Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.Now hold these in both hands, he instructed.Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.To an amazed Attila, the old man simply said,Thy anaconda don't want nun unless you've got buns, Hun.

A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night? The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.The man says, All right, all right. I’m dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 pebbles on the earth.The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door.The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, Real funny.	May I have the key?The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.The man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.

A sixteen year-old boy came home with a brand new Ford F150. His parents look at the truck and ask, Where did you get that truck?! I bought it today, he says.With what money? says his mother. They knew what a new F150 cost.Well, he says, this one cost me just fifteen dollars. The father looks at him like he's crazy. Who would sell a truck like that for fifteen dollars? he says.It was the lady up the street, says the boy. I don't know her name - they just moved in. She saw me ride past on my bike and asked me if I wanted to buy her F150 for fifteen dollars.Oh my Goodness! says the mother. Maybe she's mentally ill or has Alzheimer's something.

So the boy's father walks up the street to the house where the lady lives and finds her out in the yard calmly planting petunias.He introduces himself as the father of the boy to whom she had sold a new Ford F150 truck for fifteen dollars and asks to know why she did it.Well, she says, two days ago my husband left on a business trip. Yesterday I got a phone call from his boss and found out that he really ran off to Hawaii with his secretary and doesn't intend to come back.Oh, my goodness, I'm so sorry, the father says. But what does that have to do with my son and your truck?Well, this morning he called and told me he was stranded because he got robbed of his wallet with all his credit cards and cash. He told me to sell his new F150 and send him the money.	So I did.

Two rednecks flew to Canada on a hunting trip.    They chartered a small plane to take them into the Rockies for a week hunting moose. They managed to bag 6. As they were loading the plane to return, the Pilot said the plane could take only 4 moose. The two guys objected strongly. Last year we shot six. The pilot let us take them all and he had the same plane as yours. Reluctantly, the pilot gave in and all six were loaded. The plane took  off. However, while attempting to cross some mountains, even on full power, the little plane couldn't handle the load and went down.

Billy Bob replied, I think we're pretty close to where we crashed last year.
What starts with f and ends with k? A first-grade teacher, Ms. Brooks, was having trouble with one of her more precocious students.

Ms. Brooks asks, What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?Harry, after a moment:  Legs.Ms. Brooks:  What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?The principal wondered why would she ask such a question!Harry replied:  Pockets. to the Principal’s great relief. Ms. Brooks:  What does a dog do that a man steps into?Harry:  Pants.By now, the principal is sitting forward with his mouth hanging open.Ms. Brooks:  What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?Now the principal's eyes open really wide and before he could intervene, Harry replied, Bubble gum.Ms. Brooks:  What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?Harry:  Shake hands.The principal is now trembling with apprehension as Ms. Brooks asks the last question.Ms.	Brooks:  What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' and indicates a great deal of heat and excitement?Harry: Firetruck.The principal breaths a huge sigh of relief and tells the teacher, Put the little bastard in 5th Grade; I got the last seven questions wrong myself.

Once upon a time there lived a beautiful Queen with large breasts. Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.The moral of the story - Pay your bills !	!

Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated. Please do so again replies the Buddhist monk.But sir, says mailman, you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.But that is my intention, dear man, replies the Buddhist monk.	You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.

An infinite number of mathematicians walk into a bar. The first mathematician orders a beerThe second orders half a beerI don't serve half-beers the bartender repliesExcuse me? Asks mathematician #2What kind of bar serves half-beers? The bartender remarks. That's ridiculous.Oh c'mon says mathematician #1 do you know how hard it is to collect an infinite number of us? Just play alongThere are very strict laws on how I can serve drinks. I couldn't serve you half a beer even if I wanted to.But that's not a problem mathematician #3 chimes in at the end of the joke you serve us a whole number of beers. You see, when you take the sum of a continuously halving function-I know how limits work interjects the bartenderOh, alright then. I didn't want to assume a bartender would be familiar with such advanced mathematicsAre you kidding me? The bartender replies, you learn limits in like, 9th grade! What kind of mathematician thinks limits are advanced mathematics?HE'S ON TO US mathematician #1 screechesSimultaneously, every mathematician opens their mouth and out pours a cloud of multicolored mosquitoes. Each mathematician is bellowing insects of a different shade.The mosquitoes form into a singular, polychromatic swarm. FOOLS it booms in unison, I WILL INFECT EVERY BEING ON THIS PATHETIC PLANET WITH MALARIAThe bartender stands fearless against the technicolor hoard. But wait he inturrupts, thinking fast, if you do that, politicians will use the catastrophe as an excuse to implement free healthcare. Think of how much that will hurt the taxpayers!The mosquitoes fall silent for a brief moment. My God, you're right. We didn't think about the economy! Very well, we will not attack this dimension. FOR THE TAXPAYERS! and with that, they vanish.A nearby barfly stumbles over to the bartender. How did you know that that would work?It's simple really the bartender says.	I saw that the vectors formed a gradient, and therefore must be conservative.

Two Canadians die and end up in Hell.  The devil decides to pay them a visit, so he walks into their room and sees them talking and laughing. Confused, he asks them why they're happy.They tell him, Well, we're so sick of the cold where we're from, and this place is nice and toasty.The devil, annoyed, storms away and goes to Hell's boiler room, where he turns up the temperature. He goes back to the Canadians' room, along the way being begged by all sorts of people to put the heating back down. He enters the room to see the Canadians having a barbecue. Furiously, he asks them what they're doing.Well, we can't pass up this wonderful weather without getting out the barbecue!The devil realizes he's been doing the wrong thing. He goes to the boiler room and turns it down until it's at a colder temperature than ever seen on earth. He knows he's won now, so he goes back to the Canadians' room, only to see them jumping up and down in excitement. He shouts at them in fury, WHY ARE YOU STILL HAPPY?!?!? !They look at him and shout at the same time, Hell froze over!	That means the Leafs won!

Once upon a time there lived a ravishing Queen with huge tits.. Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear.	The King immediately summoned Nick.

Gay Couple on a Plane. A gay couple (Jeremiah and Timothy) is traveling on a plane. What if we had sex? asks Jeremiah.Are you crazy? Here, on the plane? It would be awkward, everyone would watch us doing it...Nobody is even paying attention to anything. Look!Jeremiah stands up and asks loudly:Could I have a napkin, please?Nobody gives a damn. Everyone is sleeping, reading, looking out the window, etc. Flight attendants pretend to not hear them, as they also don't give a damn.They really wouldn't care then, would they? says Timothy.So Jeremiah and Timothy have wild sex on the plane.Later, when the plane arrives to the airport and the people are leaving, the stewardess sees an old man who threw up all over his shirt, even his pants are soaking in the filth.Sir, you should've asked for a bag!I didn't dare whispers the old man.

Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community... If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each otherThe Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.The Rabbi pulled out an apple.With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue! 'Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.	'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'

I’m sure my wife won’t like this. While riding my motorbike, I swerved to avoid hitting a deer, lost control and landed in a ditch, severely banging my head.Dazed and confused I crawled out of the ditch to the edge of the road when a shiny new convertible pulled up with a very beautiful woman who asked, Are you okay?As I looked up, I noticed she was wearing a low-cut blouse with cleavage to die for...I'm okay I think, I replied as I pulled myself up to the side of the car to get a closer look.She said, Get in and I’ll take you home, so I can clean and bandage that nasty scrape on your head.That's nice of you, I answered, but I don't think my wife will like me doing that!Oh, come now, I’m a nurse, she insisted. I need to see if you have any more scrapes and then treat them properly.Well, she was pretty and very persuasive. Being sort of shaken and weak, I agreed, but repeated, I'm sure my wife won't like this.We arrived at her place which was just few miles away and, after a couple of cold beers and the bandaging, I thanked her and said, I feel a lot better, but I know my wife is going to be really upset so I'd better go now.Don't be silly! she said with a smile. Stay for a while. She won't know anything.	By the way, where is she?Still in the ditch with the motorbike, I guess.

A family is having dinner at the table one evening, when the son asks the father, Dad, how many different kinds of boobs are there? The father is a little taken aback, but he ponders for a moment before answering... Well, my son, a woman goes through three phases in life. In her 20s, her breasts are like melons, round and firm. In her 30s and 40s, they become like pears, still nice, but hanging a bit. But after 50, her breasts become like onions.The son is confused and asks, Onions?The father replies, Yes, you see them and they make you cry.The wife and daughter are really annoyed by what their father has said, so the daughter asks, Mom, how many different kinds of penises are there?The mother smiles and says, Well honey, a man also goes through three phases in life too. In his 20s, his willy is like an oak tree, mighty, strong and hard. In his 30s and 40s, it becomes more like a birch, flexible but reliable. But after 50, it's like a Christmas tree.The daughter laughs and asks, A Christmas tree?The mother replies, Yes, dear.	Dead from the root up and the balls are just for decoration.
When Beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard. A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried. Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards.He listened a while longer, and said, There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling. So the magistrate kept listening; There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about.	It's just Beethoven decomposing.

Unbutton my blouse.. A successful rancher died and left everything to his devoted wife. She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand... Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk. She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.. For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well. Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels. The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night. One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return. Two o'clock and no hired hand. Finally he returned around two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him. She quietly called him over to her.. Unbutton my blouse and take it off, she said. Trembling, he did as she directed. Now take off my boots. He did as she asked, ever so slowly.. Now take off my socks. He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots. Now take off my skirt. He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light. Now take off my bra.. Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.	Then she looked at him and said, If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired.

Balls.. A big Texan stopped at a local restaurant following a day roaming around in Mexico. While sipping his tequila, he noticed a sizzling, scrumptious looking platter being served at the next table. Not only did it look good, but the smell was wonderful. He asked the waiter, What is that you just served? The waiter replied, Ah, Señor, you have excellent taste! Those are called Cojones de Toro, bull's testicles from the bull fight this morning. A real delicacy! The cowboy said, What the heck, bring me an order. The waiter replied, I am so sorry, Señor. There is only one serving per day because there is only one bull fight each morning. If you come early and place your order, we will be sure to save you this delicacy. The next morning, the cowboy returned, placed hisorder, and that evening was served the one and only special delicacy of the day.

Three men, Joe, Bro, and Buddy, all lived in a small town. One day, Joe went hunting alone, and for the next few days no one heard from him. About a week afterwards, a body was found and brought into the coroner’s office. The coroner, after thoroughly examining the body, needed a positive identification in order to verify that the body was indeed Joe. So, he brought in Bro and Buddy, and told them to come in separately to identify the body. Bro came in first, and was asked to look for any details about the body that he recognized. After a few minutes of examining, Bro said, Mr. Coroner, I’ll need you to turn the body over for me to be sure.Confused, the coroner obliged. Bro continued to examine the body, bent down on one knee, reared his head sideways, then stood up and said, No sir, this can’t be Joe.The coroner was even more confused, but he accepted this statement and sent Bro out. Next, he invited Buddy in to repeat the task. Buddy, after examining the body in a similar fashion to Bro, also requested that the body be turned over.The coroner, after mumbling a bit about his confusion, flipped the body over. Buddy too bent down on one knee and examined the back area of the body, then, just as Bro had previously, said, No sir, Mr. Coroner, this isn’t Joe.The coroner was astonished, so he asked that Bro come back in so that the two of them were standing there at once. The coroner said, Gentlemen, this man’s dental records and features match perfectly with those of your friend Joe’s. How on earth are you both positive this isn’t him?Bro and Buddy looked at each other, then Bro answered, Sir, this can’t be Joe because Joe has two assholes.In shock, the coroner asked, How can he have two assholes? Have you ever seen them?Buddy replied, No sir, but it was common knowledge. Every time we were out with him, people would say, ‘Look, it’s Joe with those two assholes!’**Credit goes to my grandmother, who was the first to tell me this joke.	**

Men's Helpline. Hello, you have reached the Men's Help Line, my name is Bob. How can I help you?Hi Bob, I really need your advice on a serious problem. I have suspected for some time now that my wife has been cheating on me. You know, just the usual signs: The phone rings and when I answer, the caller hangs up. Plus, she goes out with the girls a lot. I usually try to stay awake to look out for her when she comes home, but I always fall asleep. Anyway, last night about midnight, I woke up and she was not home. So, I hid in the garage, behind my boat and waited for her. When she came home, she got out of someone's car, buttoning her blouse. Then she took her panties out of her purse and slipped them on. It was at that moment, while crouching behind the boat, that I noticed a hairline crack in the outboard motor mounting bracket.

When he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, I don't want to intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my condolences on your loss.The cowboy looks quite puzzled for a moment, then a light dawns in his eyes and he laughs.Oh, no, everybody's just fine, he explains.It's just that my wife and I joined the Baptist Church and I had to quit drinking.It hasn't affected my brothers though.

We may retire and do a lot of fishing.So I did some thinking and asked, How about my truck, surely you’ll sell it because all of the memories of us riding in it together will be too much for you to bear and too awkward with your next husband.She replies, You know, it is paid for with low miles, I’ll probably hang on to it.Then, getting kinda nervous, I said, Well SURELY you wont let him have my golf clubs?To which my wife responds, Oh no honey, don’t worry about that, he’s left handed.

A policeman was interrogating 3 guys who were training to become detectives. To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first guys a picture for 5 seconds and then hides it. This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?The first guy answers, That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye! The policeman says, Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile.Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?The second guy smiles, flips his hair, and says, Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!The policeman angrily responds, What's the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, This is your suspect, how would you recognize him? He quickly adds, Think hard before giving me a stupid answer.The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, the suspect wears contact lenses.The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not. Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that. He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?That's easy, the third guy replied.	He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear.

A husband notices his wife’s hearing is deteriorating and decides to visit her doctor for advice. I can’t speak to my wife directly as she might find it offensive, given our old age he says to the doc. There’s a simple trick you can try to determine her hearing explains the doctor. Simply ask her a question at a distance and if she doesn’t hear you, move slightly closer and ask again until she does. That night, the husband arrives home and sees his wife in the kitchen cooking. He thinks to himself, what a perfect opportunity to test her hearing. He stands in the doorway of the kitchen and promptly asks;What’s for dinner honey?No answer. He moves closer. What’s for dinner honey?Still no answer. He moves even closer. What’s for dinner honey?Still his wife doesn’t answer. He now sees how serious her hearing problem is.

An elderly woman walked into the Royal Bank of Ireland one morning with a purse full of money.  She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money. After many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office. The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'. The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money . The elderly woman replied that she made bets. The president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?' The elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.' The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that. The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?' 'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.' 'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.' 'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently. That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that way, up and down, turned it around, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet. The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square  The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly. The president was happy to oblige. The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.' The elderly woman did so with a little smile.	Suddenly the president noticed that the \*lawyer was banging his head against the wall.\*  He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, 'Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock this morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Royal Bank of Ireland '

11 Minutes. A cop was patrolling late at night in a well-known lover’s spot, famous for all obscene activities.

Uh, yes, officer?The cop says: What are you doing?The young man says: Well Officer, I’m reading a magazine.Pointing towards the young woman in the back seat the cop says: And her, what is she doing?The young man shrugs: Sir, I believe she’s knitting a pullover sweater.Now, the cop is totally confused.. A young couple, alone, in a car, at night in a Lover’s lane… and nothing obscene is happening!The cop asks: What’s your age, young man?

A man walks out to the street and catches a taxi just going by. He gets into the taxi, and the cabbie says, Perfect timing. You're just like Frank. Passenger: Who? Cabbie: Frank Feldman. He's a guy who did everything right all the time. Like my coming along when you needed a cab, things happened like that to Frank Feldman every single time.

But Frank, he never made a mistake, and he really knew how to treat a woman and make her feel good. He would never answer her back even if she was in the wrong; and his clothing was always immaculate, shoes highly polished too. He was the perfect man! He never made a mistake. No one could ever measure up to Frank Feldman. Passenger: How did you meet him? Cabbie: I never actually met Frank.	He died and I married his wife.

Three people die and appear before Buddha. Stunned by the divine presence before them, they lower their heads.-Raise your heads. You were humble in life and your deeds were praiseworthy. You have earned the right to a reincarnation of your choice. You have much to accomplish yet though.One of the people takes a step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled.-Benevolent Buddha, what more could I possibly do in my next life? I thought I lived and acted to the fullest. Because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve.-My work was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. Right now, the world I leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.-My connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.-I know all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that I ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation.The three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.-Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?-Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.-You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?-Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.-This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?-W-well, I don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.	(edit: obligatory editted thanks to the kind people who handed over silver & gold to my stupid joke

My grandfather died and I inherited some of his clothes. He was a farmer and he loved getting dressed up every year for the local fair and exhibiting his prize chickens. For this occasion, my grandmother would spend the entire year searching through thrift shops looking for silly neckties for him to wear, and she loved finding ones with chickens on them.After a few decades of this, my grandfather had amassed several dozen neckties, each one with cartoonish images of chickens flying around, laying eggs, and doing other chicken things. I always complimented him on the newest addition to his collection.When he died a couple of years ago, he bequeathed them to me in his will. When my grandmother handed me the bag full of them, my eyes welled with tears and I smiled thinking about my grandfather looking in the mirror and straightening his tie.Why am I telling you all of this back story?

An ancient mathematical joke. Once upon a time, there were three kingdoms, all bordering on the same lake. For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner.The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage.	The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

Tiger is a bit skeptical that the blind musician can play golf well, but he's too polite to say anything. When I tee off,  the singer explains, I have a guy call to me from the green. My sharp sense of hearing lets me aim. Tiger is impressed, and Stevie suggests that they play a round. When Tiger agrees, Stevie asks, How about if we play for $10,000 a hole? Tiger insists he couldn't possibly play him for money because of his sight handicap. But Stevie argues and badgers Tiger until Tiger finally relents. Stevie says, You pick the place and I'll pick the time? Tiger says, Fine. Pebble Beach.	Stevie replies, Midnight!

Father, do you have anything to declare? A beautiful young woman, on an international flight, asked the priest beside her, Father, may I ask a favor?Of course you may. What can I do for you?Well, I bought this expensive electronic hair dryer that is well over the Customs limits and I’m afraid  that they’ll confiscate it from me. Is there anyway that you could carry it through Customs for me? Under your robes perhaps?I would love to help you, dear, but I must warn you: I will not lie.With your honest face, Father, no one will question you.When they got to Customs, the young lady let the priest go ahead of her.	The Customs Officer asked, Father, do you have anything to declare?From the top of my head down to my waist, I have nothing to declare.The Officer thought this answer strange, so he asked, And what do you have to declare from your waist to the floor?I have a marvelous little instrument designed to be used on a woman, but which is, to date, unused.Roaring with laughter, the Officer said, God bless you, Father, go ahead.
Her: Let's exchange numbers. 	Me: Won't that confuse people who are trying to call us?

The monkey nods his head.Then the officer asked, What were you doing?Without hesitation the monkey smiles making a steering wheel gesture.
A fancy restaurant is hiring a new pianist. A guy called John comes in and says Hi there, I'm here about the pianist position. The manager replies That's fantastic, do you mind sitting at the piano and showing me what you can do?So John sits at the piano and starts to play one of the most beautiful songs the manager has ever heard. Stunned at the end of the performance he says That's absolutely wonderful, what's it called?John replies Oh it's one of my songs, I call it 'Your daughter sucked on my balls and I jizzed on her forehead'.The manager, shocked, stammers Oh, right... urr, do you have any more? The pianist resumes playing, and yet again plays an absolutely magical piece of music. The manager says Incredible! What do you call this one?John replies Oh, I call that one 'I'm going to stick my tongue up your asshole and lick your colon'.The manager says to him Ok, look, you're hired. I can't let a talent like you get away, but please never let the clients know the names of your songs, it simply won't do in an establishment like this.So John agrees and starts work that night.A few weeks later, the buzz about the restaurant is incredible, people are so enamored with this pianist they recommend their friends, come back regularly just to eat and hear this amazing music play. And one night, the pianist says to the diners OK ladies and gentlemen, after this song I'm going to take a short break and I'll resume my playing for you shortly, and goes off to take a small comfort break.As he's returning from the restroom the manager swiftly approaches him and exclaims John!

A young Law student, having failed his Law exam, goes up to his crusty old professor, who is renowned for his razor-sharp legal mind. Student, Sir, do you really understand everything about this subject? Professor, Actually, I probably do. Otherwise I wouldn't be a professor, would I? Student, OK. So I'd like to ask you a question. If you can give me the correct answer, I will accept my marks as it is. If you can't give me the correct answer, however, you'll have to give me an A. Professor, Hmmmm, alright. So what's the question? Student, What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? The professor wracks his famous brain, but just can't crack the answer. Finally he gives up and changes the student's failing mark into an A as agreed, and the student goes away, very pleased. The professor continues to wrack his brain over the question all afternoon, but still can't get the answer. So finally he calls in a group of his brightest students and tells them he has a really, really tough question to answer, What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? To the professor's surprise (and embarrassment), all the students immediately raise their hands. All right, says the professor and asks his favorite student to answer.It's quite easy, sir says the student You see, you are 75 years old and married to a 30 year old woman, which is legal, but not logical. Your wife has a 22 year old lover, which is logical, but not legal.	And your wife's lover failed his exam but you've just given him an A, which is neither legal, nor logical.

I'm onlyhere to wash your upper body and feet.He struggles to ask again, Nurse, please check for me. Are mytesticles black?Concerned that he might elevate his blood pressure and heart rate from worrying about his testicles, she overcomes her embarrassment and pulls back the covers.She raises his gown, holds his manhood in one hand and his testicles gently in the other.She looks very closely and says, There's nothing wrong with them,Sir. They look fine.The man slowly pulls off his oxygen mask, smiles at her, and says very slowly, Thank you very much.	That was wonderful.Now listen very, very closely:Are - my - test - results - back?

Honey it's the name of a horse I'm betting on this weekend! Come on! !Defeated, she apologizes and retreats back to the den.The next day the man gets home from work, and low and behold she lunges at him again as he walks through the door, smacking him left and right even more violently than the day before, shouting obscenities he didn't even know she was capable of.Jesus what did I do this time?!?	the man bellows with his arms guarding his face.The HORSE called!
Interactive joke. There was a man who lived in a 3 story house. **Remember: 3 stories. **The man entered the house and saw his wife making an omelette. He told her You're supposed to use butter, not oil. Immediately the wife slapped him and said Who's cooking? Me or or you?The man went up to the second story and saw his son playing a video game. He told him You're doing it wrong, you're supposed to- but the son slapped him, saying Who's playing? Me or you?Then he went to the third story and saw his daughter doing homework, and told her this is the wrong answer and the daughter slapped him, saying Who's doing homework? Me or you?Finally, the man went up to the fourth story. (At this point, hopefully your listener would say but you said there were only 3 stories! at which point you slap him/her and say Who's telling the joke? Me or you?	)**

Man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.You're in the afterlife! he tells the man, But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.What are the odds? they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line. The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. Come, the beggar told him, I'll take you to the evening meal. So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line, and then he added, and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. What is it, he thought, that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here? That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.The beggar laughed jovially. I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in! Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. That's the line for the dragon meat, he said before turning to the next line, and that's the line for angeldust stew, then he paused, confused.What is it?	the man asked his old friend.The beggar replied, There appears to be no punchline.

The flight attendant watches her do this, and asks to see her ticket.She then tells the blonde that she paid for economy class, and that she will have to sit in the back.The blonde replies, I’m blonde, I’m beautiful, I’m going to Sydney and I’m staying right here.The flight attendant goes into the cockpit and tells the pilot and the co-pilot that there is a blonde bimbo sitting in first class, that belongs in economy, and won’t move back to her seat.The co-pilot goes back to the blonde and tries to explain that because she only paid for economy she will have to leave and return to her seat.The blonde replies, I’m blonde, I’m beautiful, I’m going to Sydney and I’m staying right here.The co-pilot tells the pilot that he probably should have the police waiting when they land to arrest this blonde woman who won’t listen to reason.The pilot says, You say she is a blonde?

Three years ago I mistakenly bought my son a giant conch shell…. I have a son who’s on the spectrum. It’s quite common for people like him to latch onto one specific topic and become an absolute encyclopedia about it. Some people choose trains, some a cartoon. For my son, this was mollusks. Interesting topic I know, but it seemed to be a pretty good deal for us because it meant he’d get really excited about going outside to the beach which we figured was healthier than staying inside all the time. He’d always have a shell with him, or in his pocket. Usually he doesn’t want to talk much, but if you opened the conversation to it, he’d sit there rattling off facts about mollusks for hours. This was shaping up to be a long term passion, so for his 15th birthday I went out and bought him a giant conch shell. He absolutely loved it. The texture, holding it to his ear etc. It was too big to carry around with him all the time, but he kept it by his bed. Fast forward three years, this is where things get weird. About a month ago I was cleaning his room and picked up the conch to dust it off, something I’ve never actually done before. I was immediately hit by a terrible smell – I don’t want to get too into the gross details but I’m a dude, a once 18 year old dude, so I know what happens when you use something to masturbate and don’t clean it. I’m sure we all know what that smells like even after a week. It was pretty clear he had been using this shell as a kind of Strombidae fleshlight for a long, long time without cleaning it. I’m not going to share too much about what happened when this all came to light, but we tried taking it away and my god you’d think we just took his whole world. We decided to give the shell back, but worried this reflected a deeper issue my partner and I decided to get some professional help. So it’s been about a month of him seeing a behavioural therapist, and she recently asked me about his progress at home. I told her it’s been incredibly promising so far.	He’s really starting to come out of his shell.

So two aliens find their way to earth.  They land in the Arizona desert near a gas station that was closed for the night. They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien addressed it saying, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.The gas pump, of course, didn't respond.The younger alien became angry at the lack of response.The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you. 'The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response.Pissed at  the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said gruffly, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader or I will fire!The older alien again warned his comrade saying,  'You probably don't want to do that! I really think that will make him mad. ''Rubbish,' replied the cocky, young alien. He aimed his weapon  and opened fire. There was a huge explosion. A massive fireball roared towards him and blew the younger alien off his feet and threw him in a burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch.Half an hour passed. When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head. 'What a ferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien. 'He damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?	'The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, 'If there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you never mess with a guy who can loop his dick over his shoulder twice and then stick it in his ear.'

Right now, the world I leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.-My connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.-I know all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that I ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation.The three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.-Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?-Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.-You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?-Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.-This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?-W-well, I don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.	(edit: obligatory editted thanks to the kind people who handed over silver & gold to my stupid joke

So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living. He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said, Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just a bad conductor.

Five friends were sitting around, debating which Pixar movie is the greatest. After a few hours of debate, no one was willing to concede, and it was decided that a vote must be held. Unfortunately, with so few friends present, it was clear that they would need to bring the vote to the greater public. The group decided that each friend would make a plea to the subreddit of their choice, and whoever received the most karma for it would win.Adam, already undecided himself, decided to go to /r/AskReddit. He laid out the agreement, and asked that everyone vote one their favorite movie, and the one with the most votes he would use for the his friends. Unfortunately, as the votes were split in that sub, his highest post amounted to a mere 38 points.Paul, a big proponent for the Toy Story franchise, posted to /r/nostalgia in the hopes that everyone who grew up with Toy Story would agree. Unfortunately, as there had been two sequels (with a third on the way) it wasn't exactly considered nostalgia and he got downvoted into oblivion.Bill, who loved Monsters Inc., made his case using some trickery. Going to /r/news, he found a seemingly unrelated post, and made a top-level comment describing, in great detail, why Monsters Inc. was the greatest film of all time. The fact that the post was so out of context made everyone flock to it, and drew enough attention to new him over a thousand fake internet points.Mike, who loved the Incredibles movies, decided to stay in his wheelhouse. Over the course of several hours, he created each of the family members from the Incredibles in Soulcaliber VI. Finally, he photoshopped the family together, and posted it to /r/gaming. Under normal circumstances this would have skyrocketed to the top, but the format was stale, and thus only received 20k karma. Still, Mike was confident in his victory.While the other four friends came up with plans on how to maximize their karma gains, Chris sat silently. For hours he sat, making no posts, coming up with no original content. Finally, an hour before the deadline, he broke into his neighbor's house, stealing his copy of the Pixar movie Up. He took a picture of his theft and posted it directly to /r/Jokes with the title STOLEN.When the group got together the next day to see who got the most votes, everyone was in awe. Chris's post had over 40,000 points. How did you know that would win? Easy, Chris replied.	Everyone knows stolen content on /r/Jokes gets all the Up votes.

Joe was moderately successful in his career, but as he got older he was increasingly hampered by incredible headaches. When his personal hygiene and love life started to suffer, he sought medical help. After being referred from one specialist to another, he finally came across a doctor who solved the problem. The good news is I can cure your headaches; the bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press up against the base of your spine. The pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles. Joe was shocked and depressed, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife. After the operation, his mind was clear, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. He walked past a men's clothing store and thought, That's what I need, a new suit. He entered the shop and told the salesman, I'd like a new suit. The salesman eyed him briefly and said, Let's see, size 44 long? Joe laughed, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. replied the salesman. Joe tried on the suit, and it fit him perfectly. As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, How about a new shirt? Joe thought for a moment and then said, Sure!. The salesman eyed Joe, then said, Let's see, 34 sleeve and 16 and a half neck.. Joe was surprised, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. came the familiar reply. Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly, as well. The salesman asked, How about new shoes?. Joe was on a roll and agreed. The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, Let's see, nine-and-a-half? Joe was astonished, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. said the salesman, again. Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly, again. He walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, How about some new underwear? Joe thought for a second and said, Sure, why not. The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, Let's see, size 36. Joe laughed smugly, No, I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old. The shocked salesman shook his head, You can't possibly wear a size 34!	It would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache.

Just pretend you're a statue.What's this, honey? the husband inquired as he entered the room.Oh, it's just a statue, she replied nonchalantly. The Smiths bought one for their bedroom. I liked it so much, I got one for us too.No more was said about the statue, not even later that night when they went to sleep.

Three men, Joe, Bro, and Buddy, all lived in a small town. One day, Joe went hunting alone, and for the next few days no one heard from him. About a week afterwards, a body was found and brought into the coroner’s office. The coroner, after thoroughly examining the body, needed a positive identification in order to verify that the body was indeed Joe. So, he brought in Bro and Buddy, and told them to come in separately to identify the body. Bro came in first, and was asked to look for any details about the body that he recognized. After a few minutes of examining, Bro said, Mr. Coroner, I’ll need you to turn the body over for me to be sure.Confused, the coroner obliged. Bro continued to examine the body, bent down on one knee, reared his head sideways, then stood up and said, No sir, this can’t be Joe.The coroner was even more confused, but he accepted this statement and sent Bro out. Next, he invited Buddy in to repeat the task. Buddy, after examining the body in a similar fashion to Bro, also requested that the body be turned over.The coroner, after mumbling a bit about his confusion, flipped the body over. Buddy too bent down on one knee and examined the back area of the body, then, just as Bro had previously, said, No sir, Mr. Coroner, this isn’t Joe.The coroner was astonished, so he asked that Bro come back in so that the two of them were standing there at once. The coroner said, Gentlemen, this man’s dental records and features match perfectly with those of your friend Joe’s. How on earth are you both positive this isn’t him?Bro and Buddy looked at each other, then Bro answered, Sir, this can’t be Joe because Joe has two assholes.In shock, the coroner asked, How can he have two assholes? Have you ever seen them?Buddy replied, No sir, but it was common knowledge. Every time we were out with him, people would say, ‘Look, it’s Joe with those two assholes!’**Credit goes to my grandmother, who was the first to tell me this joke.	**

A German, a Frenchman and an Englishman go fishing... They fish quite happily for a while until the German catches a huge golden fish, but as he pulls it off the hook it says Please don't kill me! Spare my life and I'll grant you all a wish!The German throws the fish back and says I wish for a mug of beer that will never empty, and immediately a foaming mug of ice-cold German ale appears in his hand. He takes a long swig and when he puts it down, it's still miraculously full! The Frenchman and Englishman are, of course, amazed.I wish, said the Frenchman, For a wall to be built around France, ten miles high and ten miles thick, so that nobody can get in and nobody can get out.The fish screws up its eyes in concentration for a moment then says. Done! And what do you want?Is there a wall around France? asks the EnglishmanYes.	replies the fish.Is it ten miles high and ten miles thick?Yes.And can nobody get in, and nobody get out?Yes.Well then, says the Englishman, I want you to fill it with water.

A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?  The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.The man says, All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door.The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, Real funny.	May I have the key?The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.The man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk

A blonde, wanting to earn some money, decided to hire herself out as a odd-job man and started with a wealthy neighborhood. She went to the front door of the first house and asked the owner if he had any jobs for her to do.Well, you can paint my porch. How much will you charge?The blonde said, How about 50 dollars? The man agreed and told her that the paint and ladders that she might need were in the garage. The man's wife, inside the house, heard the conversation and said to her husband, Does she realize that the porch goes all the way around the house?The man replied, She should. She was standing on the porch.A short time later, the blonde came to the door to collect her money.

A priest told me this joke as a kid. There were 3 men, they were best friends, and they were quite unhealthy. Their names were, Bert, Chester, and Earl.They were actually really unhealthy and Bert decided that he needed to take charge of him and his friends' health. He decided that they were going to be on a diet together to help them live for as long as possible. He broke the news to his friends, and they weren't too happy about it, but they decided to go along with it anyways, because they knew how out-of-shape they all were. It was tough for them all to stick to the plan at times, however they got through it together. They each lost between 120-140 pounds over the course of 20 years and were in amazing shape for their age.One day the 3 of them were given great news.Bert got a call, he answered it, then turned around to everyone and said: Guys! My daughter just had a child! I'm going to be a grandpa!. Everybody was celebrating for Bert when Earl got a call from his son. He answered it, and turned around to everybody and said:Guys! My son is going to get married today! I'm so excited!. Everybody was now celebrating for Bert and Earl, when Chester got a call. He answered it, turned around and said to everybody: Guys! My family is having a reunion today! I'm going to see so many people that I haven't seen in years!.They found out that the wedding, hospital, and park where the reunion was were all in the same town, and decided to carpool together to get there. It had snowed a little the day before and the roads were a little icy. As they were getting onto the highway, their car slipped and ran into a semi-truck. It killed all three of them.The three of them wake up together in heaven. They notice an angel standing over them and one of them asks Where are we?. The angels says: Congratulations, you made it to heaven. The angel decides to show them around the place and starts at a banquet. Here is a banquet for you three to enjoy, you've earned it. Chester looks a little sad, and Earl notices and asks him, What's wrong?. Chester finally speaks up, Okay, this is so nice of you to put together, but we're on a diet. I wouldn't want to overdo my calorie intake for the day. The angle replies to them, No worries, you can have as much food as you like without worrying about it. The guys are elated by that news, when the angel decides to show them another place.Next, the angel decides to show them a place where they can spend time having fun. He shows them to a massive building with games everywhere you look. There are at least 50 pool tables, 30 bowling alley lanes, people are playing poker, there are arcade games everywhere, and tons of people enjoying themselves. He tells them,This is where you may spend much of your time, if you choose. Many people enjoy it here and you might find some new friends. The guys really like this room, but Earl notices that Chester is looking sad again. Earls asks him,What's wrong?. Chester responds with,My wife left me because of my gambling problems, I don't want to disappoint anyone else because of it. I'm afraid I wont be able to enjoy this area. The angel then slightly irritated lets him know,Don't you see? There are no problems here. You don't have to worry about gambling issues, because money isn't an issue here. Chester is especially happy to hear that news, and the angel decides to show them where they are going to live.The angel finally takes them to the third place, and it is a huge mansion. The guys are led inside, when the angel says, This is where you three can live, if you choose to. Otherwise we have some other mansions, if you want to live alone. The guys are very intrigued by the house, they notice a big window on a wall with an amazing view. They could see for at least 5 miles clearly. They all can't help but gasp when looking through the window. Earl can't help but be concerned about this place. He decides to ask, So, uh... What's the rent here?. The angel looks back at them with an irritated glare are replies Nothing? It's free. Earl is sure to thank the angel and says,Wow! That's so kind of you guys!. Bert notices that Chester is looking a little sad. Bert says,What's wrong Chester? Isn't it amazing here?. Chester looks up, looks Bert in the eye and says a little mad, If it weren't for your goddamn diet. Bert.	We could've been here 20 years ago!.

It's hanging down today, it was hanging down yesterday, it'll be hanging down again tomorrow. Furious, Robert yelled, and do you know why it's hanging down, Margaret? Nope. Not a clue, she replied. It's hanging down, because it's looking at my new boots!!!! Without missing a beat Margaret replied, should have bought a hat, Robert!	Should have bought a hat.

Once upon a time in an old magical kingdom, there lived an young monk called Sam... His order was renowned for their beautiful choralsinging. They trained, hours every day, refiningtheir voices and their art. Their song floateddown the mountainside, enriching the lives andsouls of the townspeople belowSam was particularly gifted, and on his 19thbirthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifullyintricate note of pure magic. Everyone withinmiles just froze in mid action, stirred to the verycore of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.And all the realm realized, instantly, that it wasSam, and Sam was the first person in historyto hit one of the rumored Magical Notes thatmusicians had theorized must exist... yet no onebefore Sam had ever reached one.And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.This time, the town below was so impactedthat no one moved, spoke, or even blink forseveral minutes after. As the golden sound finallytapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam hadfound the Second Note...And the next year on Sam's birthday, the townhad realized there was a pattern involved. Thistime, all of the townspeople were present in themonastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hitthe glorious Third Note. People cried out in purepurejoy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.Words cannot do justice to the experience. Thetown flourished, as Sam's notes made the peoplepure all the way to the core of their beings.And on it went for the next few years, the MagicalNotes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, thatis, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From thestart, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and thisnew sound was not beautiful... it was jarring anddiscordant. Sam started to get very warm, andwas visibly sweating onstage. He doubled hisresolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet partof the Magical Note that he knew must be there.Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneouslycombusted! The two closest monks on stagewere burned by the flames coming off of hisbody, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soonthe entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle,everyone made it out, except for poor SamThe townsfolk were left staring at the burningmonastery in sad, stunned disbelief.The mayor approached the lead monk of theorder.

Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community... If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each otherThe Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.The Rabbi pulled out an apple.With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue! 'Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.	'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'

A businessman is getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knows his wife is always horny, so he decides to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn’t much like the idea of her screwing someone else. So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation, to the old man.Well, I don’t really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don’t know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except a... said the old man, and then he stopped.Except what? asked the businessman.Nothing, nothing, said the old man.C’mon, tell me! I need something! protested the businessman.Well, sir, I don’t usually mention this, but there is the ‘voodoo dildo,’ the old man said.The voodoo dildo? the businessman asked.The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!The old man said, But you haven’t seen what it’ll do yet.He pointed to a door and said Voodoo dildo, the door.The voodoo dildo rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, Voodoo dildo, box!The voodoo dildo stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, motionless.The businessman said, I’ll take it!The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, Voodoo dildo, my pussy.He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.After he’d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dildo. She lay down, placed the box between her legs, and said Voodoo dildo, my pussy! The voodoo dildo shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she’d ever experienced before.After three orgasms, she decided she’d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off! So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she’d had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn’t been drinking, but that a voodoo dildo was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn’t stop screwing her.The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, Yeah, right.	Voodoo dildo, my ass!

A perfectly triangular lake has 3 kingdoms on its 3 sides. . The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.	And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

Soft music was playing, and the aroma of perfume filled the room.What are you doing?! she asked.I'm waiting for Mike to come home from work, the daughter-in- law answered.But you're naked! the mother-in-law exclaimed.This is my love dress, the daughter-in-law explained.Love dress? But you're naked!Mike loves me and wants me to wear this dress, she explained. It excites him to no end. Every time he sees me in this dress, he instantly becomes romantic and ravages me for hours on end. He can't get enough of me.The mother-in-law left. When she got home, she undressed, showered, put on her best perfume, dimmed the lights, put on a romantic CD, and lay on the couch, waiting for her husband to arrive.Finally, her husband came home. He walked in and saw her lying there so provocatively.What are you doing?	he asked.This is my love dress, she whispered sensually.Needs ironing...

A sailor and a priest are out golfing. The sailor takes his first swing and slices it hard to the left of the green. FUCK! I missed! exclaimed the sailor.My son! Please refrain from using that type of language, The Lord can hear you! gasps the priest. The sailor apologizes and they proceed with their game.The sailor now attempts to chip his ball out of the brush. He gets off a good shot, but it rolls back into a sand trap. Fuck, I missed! he says again.My son! Please, refrain from such sinful language! You will anger the Lord! the priest pleads. The sailor apologizes and they continue their game.The sailor takes a whack at his ball from the sandtrap. He has a great shot, landing the ball right on the green. Still it's not good enough for him, so yet again he mutters fuck, I missed!The priest bursts out, yelling my son! The Lord will strike you down should you continue in your sinful ways! You will be punished for your sins! The sailor apologizes profusely and lines up his putt. The putt heads straight for the hole... and then runs around the rim and stays out. FUCK! I MISSED! the sailor exclaims, louder than before.Out of nowhere, a lightning bolt shoots from the sky. It streaks down from the clouds and hits the priest, instantly killing him. A deep, booming voice from the heavens speaks... FUCK!	I MISSED!

Iron Man is a very confusing character. 	I know he’s a guy but he could’ve been Fe Male.
There was this tramp. One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.Coincidentally the father drives up. How can I ever thank you sir? he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.Ah, well... stammers the tramp, ... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.Oh dear, says the father, I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.No! No! says the tramp, Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.Ten pounds, thinks the tramp, I'm rich! I'm rich! and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. I'll have one holiday please!Ahem, which holiday would sir like? asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds, replies the tramp.TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds, says the girl incredulously.She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.Well you'll never believe it, she says to the tramp, back in the shop. I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.Yippee! exclaims the tramp, I'll take it!A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.Get off my ship ye dirty bum! shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.But I've got my ticket!, responds the tramp, super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!Well okay, says the captain, but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.Psst, says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6 pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3 deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.Sheer luxury! exclaimed the tramp, A room of my very own.I'm glad you like it, replies the captain, but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what a dive...!Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.That was amazing! exclaimed the captain, Where did you learn to dive like that?Um, well I've never actually dived before, replied the tramp.Well that's incredible! says the captain, I've never seen... He broke off. Hey, I've got an idea, he started again. How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!It's a deal! says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.Then one morning the captain comes to talk. Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.Okay, agreed the tramp.Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.Well, tramp, said the captain, shaking his hand, Let's see what you can do. And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...up and up...below him the ship grew smaller...on and on...past a solitary albatross...and still higher...till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...and on still further.../ till the ocean grew dim...and the earth itself...began to shrink...past our moon...and on...and Mars...and on...higher, and higher...through the asteroid belt...and on and on towards the diving board...past the outer planets, until...on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...he reached the board.He climbed on top and radioed the captain...and then....' '.. .. .he jumped.....:Slowly at first,:but speeding up,:::faster, and faster,:speeding past Pluto,:and the other outer planets,.........through the asteroid belt,past Mars,and the moon,faster,and faster,faster - ever faster,and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,faster, and faster,past the albatross,double-back somersault,and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,I CAN SEE HIM! yelled a passenger, LOOK!! !The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!DOWN!DOWN!THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!STILL DOWN...!DEEPER,DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,TILL.........SMASH!Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.Up and up, desperate, gasping...Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.HERO! WONDERFUL! AMAZING! GOOD SHOW THAT!And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.The tramp blushed.The captain went on, but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: Well you see...For me to tell you, I'll need $49.95The captain outrageously asked why.The tramp said The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes, As for cost, we selected initial values based upon data from the Open Beta and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch.

A fancy restaurant is hiring a new pianist. A guy called John comes in and says Hi there, I'm here about the pianist position. The manager replies That's fantastic, do you mind sitting at the piano and showing me what you can do?So John sits at the piano and starts to play one of the most beautiful songs the manager has ever heard. Stunned at the end of the performance he says That's absolutely wonderful, what's it called?John replies Oh it's one of my songs, I call it 'Your daughter sucked on my balls and I jizzed on her forehead'.The manager, shocked, stammers Oh, right... urr, do you have any more? The pianist resumes playing, and yet again plays an absolutely magical piece of music. The manager says Incredible! What do you call this one?John replies Oh, I call that one 'I'm going to stick my tongue up your asshole and lick your colon'.The manager says to him Ok, look, you're hired. I can't let a talent like you get away, but please never let the clients know the names of your songs, it simply won't do in an establishment like this.So John agrees and starts work that night.A few weeks later, the buzz about the restaurant is incredible, people are so enamored with this pianist they recommend their friends, come back regularly just to eat and hear this amazing music play. And one night, the pianist says to the diners OK ladies and gentlemen, after this song I'm going to take a short break and I'll resume my playing for you shortly, and goes off to take a small comfort break.As he's returning from the restroom the manager swiftly approaches him and exclaims John! Do you know your dick is hanging out of your trousers and the whole room can see it? !John replies Know it?!	I fucking wrote it!

An engineer dies and is sent to hell. He's hot and miserable, so he decides to take action. The A/C has been busted for a long time, so he fixes it. Things cool down quickly. The moving walkway motor jammed, so he un-jams it. People can get from place to place more easily.

The Devil says, Things are great down here since you sent us an engineer. What? says God. An engineer? I didn't send you one of those. That must have been a mistake. Send him upstairs immediately. The Devil responds, No way. We want to keep our engineer. We like him. God demands, If you don't send him to me immediately, I'll sue! The Devil laughs.	Where are YOU going to get a lawyer?

A new twist on an old joke. Scientists recently did a study on the effects the right side and left side of a brain had on counting.They first took out the left half of a man's brain and asked him to count to 10. He says, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.They put the left half back in and removed the right half, asking him to count to 10 again. He says 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.Finally they decided to just go for it and removed the whole brain. They again asked him to count to 10 one more time.He says, Look. I'm great at counting to 10, ok? I love numbers and I have the best numbers. No one has better numbers than I do. My 4th grade math teacher - and let me tell you, she was the best and smartest math teacher in the country at the time - my 4th grade math teacher said to me that I am the best counter she's ever seen. The best. So if you want me to count to 10, let me tell you I can count to 10 alright. That's no problem. I will do it. I will.	And I will do it better than any has ever done it before, ok?

Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam. His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. What happened? he asked, exasperated.The old monk shook his head sadly. Isn't it obvious? he said. Sam sung Note 7.- EDIT - Wow, I came back and this really blew up! Thanks so much for the kind comments, and upvotes, and gold.	I'm so glad I could give so many people a chuckle today!

The farmer and his wife needed a new bull... There was a man who lived on a farm with his wife in the middle of nowhere. All they owned was a truck, a few cows, and an old bull. They didn't have much, but they were happy. One day, the farmer woke up and found that the bull had died. He went to his wife and said, I take our money into the town and buy us a new bull. I know you need the truck here to keep the farm running, so when I get us a bull, I'll send you a telegraph so you know when to pick us up.His wife went and got the money and then said goodbye.The farmer arrived in town late that day and had to get a hotel room. The next morning he only had 401 dollars left. He went to the market and was able to buy a strong, young bull with the 400 dollars. It had been a long time since he had been to town, but as long as the telegraph prices hadn't gone up, he should be able to send a full sentence to his wife with his dollar.When he arrived at the post office, he said to the telegraph operator: I need to send a message to my wife so she can pick up my bull and I. How much is a word?Prices went up a few years ago, replied the operator. A word is 1 dollar.Oh no, said the farmer I can only send one word! He thought for a little while and then said, Ok, send my wife the word 'comfortable.'Comfortable? Are you sure? asked the operator.My wife has a 4th grade education, the farmer replied. When she reads she has to sound each word out syllable by syllable.	So when she sees the word comfortable, she'll read it as 'come-for-ta-bull.'

Dear, Dad.It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you.I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.I've been finding real passion with Stacy.She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes and because she is so much older than I am.But it's not only the passion, Dad.She's pregnant.Stacy said that we will be very happy.She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter.We share a dream of having many more children.Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone.We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better.She sure deserves it!Don't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself.Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.Love, your son, Joshua.P.S.	Dad, none of the above is true.I'm over at Jason's house.I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that's on the kitchen table.Call when it is safe for me to come home!

His wife replies, You were rubbing me downtown. I thought it was foreplay. The husband says, No, not at all. His wife asks angrily, Well, what the hell were you doing then?	I was just wetting my fingers so I could turn the pages in my book.

I'm keeping all my cows.Third Bull: I've only been here a year, and so far, you guys have only let me have 10 cows. I may not be as big as you fellows, but I'm keeping all 10 of my cows.Just then an 18-wheeler pulls up in the pasture carrying the biggest bull they've ever seen. At 4,700 pounds, each step he takes strains the steel ramp.First Bull: I think I can spare a few cows for our new friend.Second Bull: I actually have too many cows to take care of. I can spare a few. I'm certainly not looking for an argument.They look over at the third bull and find him pawing the dirt, shaking his horns and snorting.First Bull: Son, don't be foolish -- let him have some of your cows and live to tell about it.Third Bull: Hell, he can have all my cows.	I'm just making sure he knows I'm a bull.

A man goes to heaven, and to his surprise, he sees a huge wall covered in clocks. A man goes to heaven, and after walking through the gates, he gets escorted to a waiting room. In the room, he sees a huge wall, covered in clocks. Each clock has only one hand, and each hand has a name written on it. Some clocks are moving rather slowly, while others go a full circle in less than ten seconds. The man asks one of the angels there about the strange wall. The angel responds:Each clock in this room represents a country back on Earth. You see, each clock has the country's name written on the hand, and each time a person from that country commits a sinful act, the hand on said clock goes forward a bit. The bigger the country the bigger the clock.Intrigued by this, the man seeks out the clock of his own country, Canada. And what do you know, there it is, going forward one step at a time. He looks at all the other clocks, like Russia, the biggest if them all. Right next to Russia is tiny Estonia, and next to that Finland, Sweden and Norway, all going steadily forward, almost simultaneously.But one clock is missing. The man asks the angel, Where is the American clock? I thought it would be pretty big, but I can't see it anywhere.The angel responds:Ah yes, that one. An arrangement was made to have that one transferred to hell.The man asks:Huh? Why is that?	To which the angel responds:It's being used as the ceiling fan in the smoking room.

Stunned at the end of the performance he says That's absolutely wonderful, what's it called?John replies Oh it's one of my songs, I call it 'Your daughter sucked on my balls and I jizzed on her forehead'.The manager, shocked, stammers Oh, right... urr, do you have any more? The pianist resumes playing, and yet again plays an absolutely magical piece of music. The manager says Incredible! What do you call this one?John replies Oh, I call that one 'I'm going to stick my tongue up your asshole and lick your colon'.The manager says to him Ok, look, you're hired. I can't let a talent like you get away, but please never let the clients know the names of your songs, it simply won't do in an establishment like this.So John agrees and starts work that night.A few weeks later, the buzz about the restaurant is incredible, people are so enamored with this pianist they recommend their friends, come back regularly just to eat and hear this amazing music play. And one night, the pianist says to the diners OK ladies and gentlemen, after this song I'm going to take a short break and I'll resume my playing for you shortly, and goes off to take a small comfort break.As he's returning from the restroom the manager swiftly approaches him and exclaims John! Do you know your dick is hanging out of your trousers and the whole room can see it? !John replies Know it?!	I fucking wrote it!

Donald Trump was visiting a primary school and he visited one of the classes. They were in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings. The teacher asked the President if he would like to lead the discussion on the word tragedy. So the illustrious leader asked the class for an example of a tragedy. One little boy stood up and offered: If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs over him and kills him, that would be a tragedy. No, said Trump, that would be an accident A little girl raised her hand: If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy. I’m afraid not, explained the president. That’s what we would call great loss. The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Trump searched the room. Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? Finally at the back of the room a small boy raised his hand... In a quiet voice he said: If ‘Air Force One’ was carrying you and was struck by a friendly fire missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy. Fantastic! exclaimed Trump. That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be tragedy?	Well, said the boy, It has to be a tragedy, because it certainly wouldn’t be a great loss, and it probably wouldn’t be a fucking accident either.

A Scotsman, Englishman and an Irishman were drinking at a bar. As good as this bar is, said the Scotsman, I still prefer the pubs  back home. In Glasgow , there's a wee place called McTavish's. The  landlord goes out of his way for the locals. When you buy four drinks,  he'll buy the fifth drink.Well, Angus, said the Englishman, At my local in London , the Red  Lion, the barman will buy you your third drink after you buy the first  two.Ahhh, dat's nothin', said the Irishman, back home in my favorite  pub, the moment you set foot in the place, they'll buy you a drink,  then another, all the drinks you like, actually.

A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night? The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.The man says, All right, all right. I’m dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 pebbles on the earth.The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door.The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, Real funny.	May I have the key?The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.The man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.
My grandfather died and I inherited some of his clothes. He was a farmer and he loved getting dressed up every year for the local fair and exhibiting his prize chickens. For this occasion, my grandmother would spend the entire year searching through thrift shops looking for silly neckties for him to wear, and she loved finding ones with chickens on them.After a few decades of this, my grandfather had amassed several dozen neckties, each one with cartoonish images of chickens flying around, laying eggs, and doing other chicken things. I always complimented him on the newest addition to his collection.When he died a couple of years ago, he bequeathed them to me in his will. When my grandmother handed me the bag full of them, my eyes welled with tears and I smiled thinking about my grandfather looking in the mirror and straightening his tie.Why am I telling you all of this back story?	Because the last time I tried to tell this to someone and I didn't give context, they thought it was weird that I was so excited about inheriting my dead grandfather's hen tie collection.

Your DUCK IS DEAD. A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest.After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.The distressed woman wailed, Are you sure?Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead, replied the vet..How can you be so sure? she protested.. I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.The vet looked at the woman and said, I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. $1,500! she cried,$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!The vet shrugged, I'm sorry.	If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500.

An atheist dies and goes to hell. The devil welcomes him and says:Let me show you around a little bit.They walk through a nice park with green trees and the devil shows him a huge palace. This is your house now, here are your keys.The man is happy and thanks the devil. The devil says:No need to say thank you, everyone gets a nice place to live in when they come down here!They continue walking through the nice park, flowers everywhere, and the devil shows the atheist a garage full of beautiful cars. These are your cars now! and hands the man all the car keys. Again, the atheist tries to thank the devil, but he only says Everyone down here gets some cool cars! How would you drive around without having cars?.They walk on and the area gets even nicer. There are birds chirping, squirrels running around, kittens everywhere.They arrive at a fountain, where the most beautiful woman the atheist has ever seen sits on a bench. She looks at him and they instantly fall in love with each other. The man couldn´t be any happier. The devil says Everyone gets to have their soulmate down here, we don´t want anyone to be lonely!As they walk on, the atheist notices a high fence. He peeks to the other side and is totally shocked. There are people in pools of lava, screaming in pain, while little devils run around and stab them with their tridents. Other devils are skinning people alive, heads are spiked, and many more terrible things are happening.	A stench of sulfur is in the air.Terrified, the man stumbles backwards, and asks the devil What is going on there?The devil just shrugs and says: Those are the christians, I don´t know why, but they prefer it that wayedit: fucked up punchline, thanks to u/Tjurit for pointing ou

One day in the future, Donald Trump has a heart-attack and dies. He immediately goes to Hell, where the devil is waiting for him.I don't know what to do here, says the devil. You're on my list, but I have no room for you.You definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I've got three folks here who weren't quite as bad as you.I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU decide who leaves.Donald thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room.In it was Barack Obama and a large pool of water. Barack kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed. Over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. Such was his fate in hell.No, Donald said. I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and it would ruin my hair.I don't think I could do that all day long.The devil led him to the door of the next room.In it was Al Gore with a sledge-hammer and a room full of rocks.All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.No, this is no good; I've got his problem with my shoulder.I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day, commented Donald.The devil opened a third door. Through it, Donald saw Bill Clinton, lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head and his legs restrained in a spread-eagle pose.	Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.Donald looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said, Yeah man, I can handle this.The devil smiled and said..........OK, Monica, you're free to go.

A professional gambler wins big and dies of an aneurysm. When he gets to the afterlife, he finds himself at the back of a miles-long line to get into Heaven.Drawing on his experience, the gambler immediately thinks of a way to get ahead of everyone else. He taps the old man ahead of him on the shoulder...Want to make a bet while we wait? The Gambler asks. If I can guess your last words in three tries, you have to let me cut ahead of you.The old man, having nothing better to do, agrees. Immediately, the gambler begins reading him like the pro player he is. He notices the elderly Asian man's shirt is open, exposing a pair of defibrillator marks.Don't be silly, it's just indigestion. the gambler remarks. The old man looks a bit surprised, then steps aside, giving up his place in line.Next, the gambler taps on a redneck's shoulder. He makes the same bet, and the redneck also accepts.This one's easy! the gambler smirks, sizing up the bruised, bloody, grass stained redneck with the caved in skull. Hold my beer!Muttering profanities, the redneck begrudgingly steps aside and gives up his place in line.Riding the high of a hot streak, the gambler wastes no time tapping the next man ahead of him on the shoulder. He quickly makes the same bet, and is ecstatic when the agreement is made.Okay, let's see... The gambler studies the new mark carefully. He's a large, imposing black man riddled with several bullet holes.The gambler holds his hand out like a gun. You ain't taking me alive!The man shakes his head. Wrong. The gambler strokes his chin. The guy is giving him nothing else to work with.The gambler holds the 'gun' sideways, makes a mean face, and shouts, Fuck the police!Wrong again. The gambler's getting frustrated, now. He's never been unable to read someone before.Finally, the gambler throws his hands in the air. I'VE GOT NOTHING! He shouts.	I GIVE UP!The man steps aside.

And she noticed... What's wrong? Scarlett Johansson asked, Nothing... the guy would say...She pestered him for a while eventually saying she would do ANYTHING he needed or wanted to make him feel good again, just because she really cared for him a lot, and even if he wasn't asking, she felt it was the least she owed it to him...Really?, you'll do anything I'd like?yes she said anything!ok, first i want you to take off you toga and get into this pair of work jeans that somehow washed on the shoreok...now put this shirt on please, but first, tape your boobs so they are flatwha... ok, I'd say I'd do anything she said lovingly.ok, now, take this hat and wear it, but tuck your hair under itShe was kinda confused, but non the less, she wanted to make him happy, so she tucked her hair under the hat.Now id like for you to grab this piece of soot and paint yourself a beard and a mustacheok... if this is what you want... she muttered.now, please, put on these sunglasses, and start walking down the beach I'll catch up to you in a bit, he said a bit excited...She started walking... wondering... doubting herself... just confused about what had just happened, maybe it wasn't her, maybe it was h... suddenly the guy grabs her by her shoulder turns her around and says: DUDE!!!	you won't believe who I've been fucking for the past 6 months!

So, in amazement, he takes the twenty and walks to the cash register to make the change. While he's standing in front of the cash register he stops for a second and thinks to himself, Let me try something here and see if the gorilla notices anything. So he walks back over to the gorilla and hands him a dollar change. The gorilla doesn't say anything, he just sits there sipping the martini. After a few minutes the bartender just can't take it anymore. You know, he says to the gorilla, we don't get too many gorillas in here.	And the gorilla says, At nineteen dollars a drink I'm not surprised.

A man goes to heaven, and to his surprise, he sees a huge wall covered in clocks. A man goes to heaven, and after walking through the gates, he gets escorted to a waiting room. In the room, he sees a huge wall, covered in clocks. Each clock has only one hand, and each hand has a name written on it. Some clocks are moving rather slowly, while others go a full circle in less than ten seconds. The man asks one of the angels there about the strange wall. The angel responds:Each clock in this room represents a country back on Earth. You see, each clock has the country's name written on the hand, and each time a person from that country commits a sinful act, the hand on said clock goes forward a bit. The bigger the country the bigger the clock.Intrigued by this, the man seeks out the clock of his own country, Canada. And what do you know, there it is, going forward one step at a time. He looks at all the other clocks, like Russia, the biggest if them all. Right next to Russia is tiny Estonia, and next to that Finland, Sweden and Norway, all going steadily forward, almost simultaneously.But one clock is missing. The man asks the angel, Where is the American clock? I thought it would be pretty big, but I can't see it anywhere.The angel responds:Ah yes, that one. An arrangement was made to have that one transferred to hell.The man asks:Huh? Why is that?	To which the angel responds:It's being used as the ceiling fan in the smoking room.

The Devil says, Things are great down here since you sent us an engineer. What? says God. An engineer? I didn't send you one of those. That must have been a mistake. Send him upstairs immediately. The Devil responds, No way. We want to keep our engineer. We like him. God demands, If you don't send him to me immediately, I'll sue! The Devil laughs.	Where are YOU going to get a lawyer?

He demanded to speak with Satan.Why do you have this man when he lived righteously and has a place in heaven?

Father, do you have anything to declare? A beautiful young woman, on an international flight, asked the priest beside her, Father, may I ask a favor?Of course you may. What can I do for you?Well, I bought this expensive electronic hair dryer that is well over the Customs limits and I’m afraid  that they’ll confiscate it from me. Is there anyway that you could carry it through Customs for me? Under your robes perhaps?I would love to help you, dear, but I must warn you: I will not lie.With your honest face, Father, no one will question you.When they got to Customs, the young lady let the priest go ahead of her.

What is the best Donald Trump joke you've heard? Don’t know if this one is in here yet, but here goes:Trump is visiting a class in an elementary school where they are talking about words and meanings. The teacher asks Trump if he would like to lead the class in a discussion of the word tragedy. (No, not the punch line yet)So he asks the class for an example of a tragedy. One little boy stands up and offers, if my best friend who lives on a farm is playing in a field and a runaway tractor comes along and knocks him dead, that’d be a tragedy.Not quite, says Mr. Trump, that would be an accident.A little girl raises her hand: if a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.I’m afraid not, explained the president. That’s what we would call a great loss.The room goes silent. Trump searches the room. Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? Finally at the back of the room, little Johnny raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says, If Air Force One, carrying you was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens; that would be a tragedy.Fantastic! exclaimed Mr. Trump. That’s right.

Scotsman, Englishman, and an Irishman walk into a bar. Sitting in a bar the Scotsman says, As good as this bar is, I still prefer the pubs back home. In Glasgow, there's a wee place. The landlord goes out of his way for the locals. When you buy four drinks, he'll buy the fifth drink. Well, said the Englishman, At my local in London , the barman will buy you your third drink after you buy the first two. Ahhh, dat's nothin', said the Irishman, back home in my favorite pub, the moment you set foot in the place, they'll buy you a drink, then another, all the drinksyou like, actually. Then, when you've had enough drinks, they'll take you upstairs and see that you gets laid, all on the house! The Englishman and Scotsman were suspicious of the claims. The Irishman swore every word was true.	Then the Englishman asked, Did this actually happen to you?Not to me, personally, no, admitted the Irishman, but it did happen to me sister quite a few times.

Cheating Wives. A guy thought his wife was cheating on him. He waited for her to leave that night and jumped in a cab to follow her. By following her, he found out she was working in a whore house.The guy says to the cabbie, Wanna make a $100?The cabbie says, Sure, what do I have to do?The guy replies that all the cabbie has to do is go inside the whore house, grab his wife, put her in the back of the cab, and take them home.The cabbie goes in. A couple of minutes later, the whore house door gets kicked open, and the cabbie starts dragging out this woman who is kicking, biting, punching, and fighting all the way to the cab.The cabbie opens the door to the cab, throws the girl inside, and tells the man, Here! Hold her!The man looks down at the girl and yells to the cabbie, THIS AIN'T MY WIFE!The cabbie replied, I KNOW. IT'S MINE...	I'M GOING BACK IN FOR YOURS!

I take my shoes off before I go into the house, I sneak up the stairs, I get undressed in the bathroom. I ease into bed and my wife STILL wakes up and yells at me for staying out so late!His buddy looks at him and says, Well, you're obviously taking the wrong approach. I screech into the driveway, slam the door, storm up the steps, throw my shoes into the closet, jump into bed, rub my hands on my wife's ass and say, 'How about a blowjob?'	... and she's always sound asleep.

Your DUCK IS DEAD. A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest.After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.The distressed woman wailed, Are you sure?Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead, replied the vet..How can you be so sure? she protested.. I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.The vet looked at the woman and said, I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. $1,500! she cried,$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!The vet shrugged, I'm sorry.	If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500.
A sailor and a priest are out golfing. The sailor takes his first swing and slices it hard to the left of the green. FUCK! I missed! exclaimed the sailor.My son! Please refrain from using that type of language, The Lord can hear you! gasps the priest. The sailor apologizes and they proceed with their game.The sailor now attempts to chip his ball out of the brush. He gets off a good shot, but it rolls back into a sand trap. Fuck, I missed! he says again.My son! Please, refrain from such sinful language! You will anger the Lord! the priest pleads. The sailor apologizes and they continue their game.The sailor takes a whack at his ball from the sandtrap. He has a great shot, landing the ball right on the green. Still it's not good enough for him, so yet again he mutters fuck, I missed!The priest bursts out, yelling my son! The Lord will strike you down should you continue in your sinful ways! You will be punished for your sins! The sailor apologizes profusely and lines up his putt. The putt heads straight for the hole... and then runs around the rim and stays out. FUCK! I MISSED! the sailor exclaims, louder than before.Out of nowhere, a lightning bolt shoots from the sky. It streaks down from the clouds and hits the priest, instantly killing him. A deep, booming voice from the heavens speaks... FUCK!	I MISSED!

Man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.You're in the afterlife! he tells the man, But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.What are the odds? they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line. The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. Come, the beggar told him, I'll take you to the evening meal. So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line, and then he added, and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. What is it, he thought, that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here? That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.The beggar laughed jovially. I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in! Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. That's the line for the dragon meat, he said before turning to the next line, and that's the line for angeldust stew, then he paused, confused.What is it?	the man asked his old friend.The beggar replied, There appears to be no punchline.
An easy question to Albert Einstein! One day, Einstein has to speak at an important science conference.On the way there, he tells his driver that looks a bit like him: I'm sick of all these conferences. I always say the same things over and over!The driver agrees: You're right. As your driver, I attended all of them, and even though I don't know anything about science, I could give the conference in your place. That's a great idea! says Einstein. Let's switch places then! So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it. But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.	The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says : Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.

A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up. So, he opens the box and picks up the letter. He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters. When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail. He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it. The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter. *Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, Ding-dong. *The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.Pardon me, sir, the mailman says, but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.Ah, my letter. Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated. Please do so again replies the Buddhist monk.But sir, says mailman, you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.But that is my intention, dear man, replies the Buddhist monk.

Oh, how nice (A joke from my 96 year old great-grandmother-in-law) Two women are in the hospital. Their labor has started, but not progressed enough for delivery, so they are in a room waiting together.Is this your first child? says the older woman.No, says the younger woman. I have another.I have three. Continues the older woman. After the first kid, my husband was so sweet. He bought me a diamond necklace.Oh, how nice. Said the young woman.After the second, he bought me a new car. He said I deserve the best.Oh, how nice. Said the younger woman.And after the third, he bought us a new house. It was expensive, but he said his family was worth it.Oh, how nice. Said the younger woman.So, what has your husband gotten you?Well, we only have one child. After he was born, my husband thought I needed to clean up my language, so he got me lessons at charm school.Is that so?Yes.	Now instead of saying 'go fuck yourself,' I say 'oh, how nice'.

See that enemy soldier manning that machine gun there? Run across the mines into the trenches and kill him with a knife.Da, Comrade General!The russian soldier bravely charges across the minefield under heavy fire, jumped into the trenches fought his way through many enemy soldier then being shot many times from the machine gun nest before reaching that soldier and slicing his throat after a bloody brawl.Nobody more brave than Russian soldier.The American general, unimpressed said Let me show you all what real courage is.He calls one of his men over.Private! See that enemy command post over there? I want you to run naked across the minefields, fight your way through the trenches, go to the command post and kill the commanding officer bare handed!Without hesitation, the American soldier flips him the bird and saysGo fuck yourself, General.See!	Now that takes some real balls!

A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up. So, he opens the box and picks up the letter. He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters. When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail. He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it. The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter. *Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, Ding-dong. *The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.Pardon me, sir, the mailman says, but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.Ah, my letter. Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated. Please do so again replies the Buddhist monk.But sir, says mailman, you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.But that is my intention, dear man, replies the Buddhist monk.	You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.

George thought - who could it be ?Then the doorbell rang again. He got up and walked up to the door. As he opened the door, he was greeted by this young bombshell blonde, donned in a sexy little red dress with matching red lipstick and red heels.	As he says Hi,she replies - Are you George ?He says- Yes, I am.She says - I am from SuperSex.George pauses for a minute.And then says nonchalantly, I'll have the soup please.
4 years ago today, I shared the worst joke I ever created. Here it is again for those that missed it. There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted. About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off. The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak. The grim reaper swears. Oh no! This always happens with identical twins. What do you mean? asks the dentist. Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now. The dentist is noticeably upset. He says Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life. The grim reaper asks What do you have in mind? The dentist thinks. How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free. The grim reaper laughs. I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose? The dentist smiles. I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide. Very well says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom. Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance. The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles. It's unbelievable. The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth. The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. You win, human. This time. Your brother will live. He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died. The dentist smiles on the phone and says. That's interesting, bro.	Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.

A Jewish man on the subway is reading an Arab newspaper. A friend of his, who happened to be riding in the same subway car, noticed this strange phenomenon. Very upset, he approached him. Moshe, have you lost your mind? Why are you reading an Arab newspaper? Moshe replied, I used to read the Jewish newspaper, but what did I find?

A man's fence is broken and he neess to hire someone to fix it. So he goes online to find someone to fix his fence for him but he is unsatisfied with their prices, that is until he finds a Buddhist monk who will do it for free.He is initially surprised by this and assumes it might be a fake listing, but since it's free he feels like he has nothing to lose so he hires him.Sure enough a few days later the monk shows up with a toolkit in hand, the man shows the monk that his fence has been ripped out of the ground and that he needs to replace it.About an hour later the monk walks in and tells the man he is finished, and when the man goes outside he sees that the fence is perfect, thinking he can't just tell the monk to leave after doing such a great job for free he invites the monk inside for a cup of coffee.The man then starts talking to the monk, It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it?	he askedthe monk replied Religious reasons.The man then says I don't know much about Buddhism, why do you need to repair fences?Because the monk replied, You would be surprised at the amount of karma you get for reposting.

There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living... There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.The man was perfectly fine.Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just a bad conductor.

Then we'll talk about the car The boy thought about that for a moment, decided he'd settle for the offer and they agreed on it.After about six weeks his father said, Son, you've brought your grades up and I've observed that you have been studying your Bible, but I'm disappointed you haven't had your hair cut.	The boy said, You know, Dad, I've been thinking about that, and I've noticed in my studies of the Bible that Samson had long hair, John the Baptist had long hair, Moses had long hair, and there's even strong evidence that Jesus had long hair.The father responded, Did you also notice that they all walked everywhere they went?

A politician dies. Instead of going straight to heaven or hell, a spirit appears to him. The spirit tells him that, rather than being judged for his sins, he gets to choose whether he goes to heaven or hell. The politician replies that of course he wants to go to heaven. The spirit tells him that before he chooses, he has to visit both places so each one will get a fair chance.First they visit heaven. It looks pretty nice. Big fluffy clouds, angels singing and playing harps, everyone seeming to enjoy themselves. The politician is pleased, if a bit underwhelmed.Hell, on the other hand, is magnificent. It’s the most beautiful place the politician has ever seen, and everyone there is having the time of their lives. It has a buffet table filled with delicious-smelling food, a beautiful garden, a pool with a water slide, a dance floor, a massage parlor, and innumerable other attractions. It makes heaven look dull and boring and comparison.I can’t believe I’m saying this, says the politician, but I think I’d rather go to hell! Very well, says the spirit. Turn around.When the politician turns around, though, hell appears to be completely different than it had been less than a minute ago.

A married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine that would transfer a portion of the mother's labor pain to the father. He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it.The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine.The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him. The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain.	She and her husband were ecstatic.When they got home, the mailman was dead on the porch.

May I have the key?The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.The man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.

In a crowded city at a bus stop, a beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in a tight leather mini skirt, with matching tight leather boots and jacket... As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus. Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't! So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. With a coy little smile to the driver, she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step.About this time, a big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, How dare you touch my body!!	I don't even know who you are!At this, the Texan drawled, Well ma'am normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends.

So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living. He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said, Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just a bad conductor.

A guy was walking down the street when he sees a woman with perfect breasts. He says to her, Hey, miss, would you let me bite your breasts for $100?

So the woman thinks about this for a while and says, Hmmmmm, $10,000? She thinks a bit OK, but just once, and not here.

The poor kid broke into a sweat trying to maintain eye contact.After a few minutes of flirting, she placed her hand on his arm and said, Let's go to my apartment, I hear someone coming.He followed her into her apartment; she closed the door and leaned against it, allowing her robe to fall off completely. Now nude, she purred at him, What would you say is my best feature?Flustered and embarrassed, he finally squeaked, It has to be your ears.Astounded, and a little hurt she asked, My ears?

Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community... If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each otherThe Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.The Rabbi pulled out an apple.With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue! 'Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.	'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'

Then we'll talk about the car The boy thought about that for a moment, decided he'd settle for the offer and they agreed on it.After about six weeks his father said, Son, you've brought your grades up and I've observed that you have been studying your Bible, but I'm disappointed you haven't had your hair cut.	The boy said, You know, Dad, I've been thinking about that, and I've noticed in my studies of the Bible that Samson had long hair, John the Baptist had long hair, Moses had long hair, and there's even strong evidence that Jesus had long hair.The father responded, Did you also notice that they all walked everywhere they went?

Three people die and appear before Buddha. Stunned by the divine presence before them, they lower their heads.-Raise your heads. You were humble in life and your deeds were praiseworthy. You have earned the right to a reincarnation of your choice. You have much to accomplish yet though.One of the people takes a step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled.-Benevolent Buddha, what more could I possibly do in my next life? I thought I lived and acted to the fullest. Because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve.-My work was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. Right now, the world I leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.-My connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.-I know all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that I ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation.The three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.-Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?-Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.-You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?-Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.-This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?-W-well, I don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.	(edit: obligatory editted thanks to the kind people who handed over silver & gold to my stupid joke

Dad, none of the above is true.I'm over at Jason's house.I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that's on the kitchen table.Call when it is safe for me to come home!

My grandfather died and I inherited some of his clothes. He was a farmer and he loved getting dressed up every year for the local fair and exhibiting his prize chickens. For this occasion, my grandmother would spend the entire year searching through thrift shops looking for silly neckties for him to wear, and she loved finding ones with chickens on them.After a few decades of this, my grandfather had amassed several dozen neckties, each one with cartoonish images of chickens flying around, laying eggs, and doing other chicken things. I always complimented him on the newest addition to his collection.When he died a couple of years ago, he bequeathed them to me in his will. When my grandmother handed me the bag full of them, my eyes welled with tears and I smiled thinking about my grandfather looking in the mirror and straightening his tie.Why am I telling you all of this back story?	Because the last time I tried to tell this to someone and I didn't give context, they thought it was weird that I was so excited about inheriting my dead grandfather's hen tie collection.

Men's Helpline. Hello, you have reached the Men's Help Line, my name is Bob. How can I help you?Hi Bob, I really need your advice on a serious problem. I have suspected for some time now that my wife has been cheating on me. You know, just the usual signs: The phone rings and when I answer, the caller hangs up. Plus, she goes out with the girls a lot. I usually try to stay awake to look out for her when she comes home, but I always fall asleep. Anyway, last night about midnight, I woke up and she was not home. So, I hid in the garage, behind my boat and waited for her. When she came home, she got out of someone's car, buttoning her blouse. Then she took her panties out of her purse and slipped them on. It was at that moment, while crouching behind the boat, that I noticed a hairline crack in the outboard motor mounting bracket.

GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE!The leader, unsure whether or not he is doing more harm than good, eventually says, Ok! Ok!

When Beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard. A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried. Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards.He listened a while longer, and said, There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling. So the magistrate kept listening; There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about.	It's just Beethoven decomposing.

Most people would wish for a million or five million or whatever. This way, you’ll never run out of money, you don’t have to worry about carrying it, and you’ll never be robbed! Absolutely brilliant.The man says, I know, and thank you!The bartender says, So what did you ask for with your other two wishes?	The man said A chick with long legs and a tight pussy.

The farmer and his wife needed a new bull... There was a man who lived on a farm with his wife in the middle of nowhere. All they owned was a truck, a few cows, and an old bull. They didn't have much, but they were happy. One day, the farmer woke up and found that the bull had died. He went to his wife and said, I take our money into the town and buy us a new bull. I know you need the truck here to keep the farm running, so when I get us a bull, I'll send you a telegraph so you know when to pick us up.His wife went and got the money and then said goodbye.The farmer arrived in town late that day and had to get a hotel room. The next morning he only had 401 dollars left. He went to the market and was able to buy a strong, young bull with the 400 dollars. It had been a long time since he had been to town, but as long as the telegraph prices hadn't gone up, he should be able to send a full sentence to his wife with his dollar.When he arrived at the post office, he said to the telegraph operator: I need to send a message to my wife so she can pick up my bull and I. How much is a word?Prices went up a few years ago, replied the operator. A word is 1 dollar.Oh no, said the farmer I can only send one word!

One day in the future, Donald Trump has a heart-attack and dies. He immediately goes to Hell, where the devil is waiting for him. I don't know what to do here, says the devil.You are on my list, but I have no room for you. You definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I've got three folks here who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU decide who leaves.Donald thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room.In it, was Richard Nixon and a  large pool of water. Nixon kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed. Over, and over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. Such was his fate in  hell.No, Donald said. I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and it would ruin my hair. I don't think I could do that all day  long.The devil led him to the door of the next room. In it, was Ronald Reagan with a sledge-hammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that  hammer, time after time after time. No, this is no good; I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day, commented Donald.The devil opened a third door. Through it, Donald saw Bill Clinton, lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head, and his legs restrained in a spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.	Donald looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said, Yeah man, I can handle this.The devil smiled and said, Okay: Monica, you're free to go.
A young Law student, having failed his Law exam, goes up to his crusty old professor, who is renowned for his razor-sharp legal mind. Student, Sir, do you really understand everything about this subject? Professor, Actually, I probably do. Otherwise I wouldn't be a professor, would I? Student, OK. So I'd like to ask you a question. If you can give me the correct answer, I will accept my marks as it is. If you can't give me the correct answer, however, you'll have to give me an A. Professor, Hmmmm, alright. So what's the question? Student, What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? The professor wracks his famous brain, but just can't crack the answer. Finally he gives up and changes the student's failing mark into an A as agreed, and the student goes away, very pleased. The professor continues to wrack his brain over the question all afternoon, but still can't get the answer. So finally he calls in a group of his brightest students and tells them he has a really, really tough question to answer, What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? To the professor's surprise (and embarrassment), all the students immediately raise their hands. All right, says the professor and asks his favorite student to answer.It's quite easy, sir says the student You see, you are 75 years old and married to a 30 year old woman, which is legal, but not logical. Your wife has a 22 year old lover, which is logical, but not legal.	And your wife's lover failed his exam but you've just given him an A, which is neither legal, nor logical.

A journalist asked Tim Cook why iPhones are so expensive. Well, said Tim Cook, that's because the iPhone replaces a whole bunch of devices. A phone, a camera, a watch, a music player, a video player, a PDA, a voice recorder, a GPS navigator, a flashlight, a calculator, a portable gaming console, and many other things. Surely, a high price is worth paying to replace so many devices!Then why are Androids so much cheaper?, asked the journalist.Because, said Tim Cook, an Android replaces just one device.	The iPhone.

An HR manager was knocked down (tragically) by a bus and was killed. Her soul arrived at the Pearly Gates, where St.Peter welcomed her. Before you get settled in he said, We have a little problem…you see, we’ve never had a HR manager make it this far before and we’re not really sure what to do with you.Oh, I see, said the woman, can’t you just let me in?Well, I’d like to, said St Peter, But I have higher orders. We’re instructed to let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you’d like to go for all eternity.Actually, I think I’d prefer heaven, said the woman. Sorry, we have rules… at which St. Peter put the HR manager into the downward bound elevator.As the doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times.They played a perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed a superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had a wonderful night telling jokes and dancing.Before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. Now it’s time to spend a day in heaven, he said.So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day’s end St. Peter returned. So, he said, You’ve spent a day in hell and you’ve spent a day in heaven. You must choose between the two.The woman thought for a second and replied: Well, heaven is certainly lovely, but I actually had a better time in hell. I choose Hell.Accordingly, St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her.I don’t understand, stuttered the HR manager, The other day I was here, and there was a golf course, and a country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had a wonderful happy time.	Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.The Devil simply looked at her and smiled, Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you’re staff.

Tiger is a bit skeptical that the blind musician can play golf well, but he's too polite to say anything. When I tee off,  the singer explains, I have a guy call to me from the green. My sharp sense of hearing lets me aim. Tiger is impressed, and Stevie suggests that they play a round. When Tiger agrees, Stevie asks, How about if we play for $10,000 a hole?

Two Canadians die and end up in Hell.  The devil decides to pay them a visit, so he walks into their room and sees them talking and laughing. Confused, he asks them why they're happy.They tell him, Well, we're so sick of the cold where we're from, and this place is nice and toasty.The devil, annoyed, storms away and goes to Hell's boiler room, where he turns up the temperature. He goes back to the Canadians' room, along the way being begged by all sorts of people to put the heating back down. He enters the room to see the Canadians having a barbecue. Furiously, he asks them what they're doing.Well, we can't pass up this wonderful weather without getting out the barbecue!The devil realizes he's been doing the wrong thing. He goes to the boiler room and turns it down until it's at a colder temperature than ever seen on earth. He knows he's won now, so he goes back to the Canadians' room, only to see them jumping up and down in excitement.

A young Law student, having failed his Law exam, goes up to his crusty old professor, who is renowned for his razor-sharp legal mind. Student, Sir, do you really understand everything about this subject? Professor, Actually, I probably do. Otherwise I wouldn't be a professor, would I? Student, OK. So I'd like to ask you a question. If you can give me the correct answer, I will accept my marks as it is. If you can't give me the correct answer, however, you'll have to give me an A. Professor, Hmmmm, alright. So what's the question? Student, What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? The professor wracks his famous brain, but just can't crack the answer. Finally he gives up and changes the student's failing mark into an A as agreed, and the student goes away, very pleased. The professor continues to wrack his brain over the question all afternoon, but still can't get the answer. So finally he calls in a group of his brightest students and tells them he has a really, really tough question to answer, What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal?

A woman joins a country club and when she hears the guys talking about their golf round, she says, I played on my college's golf team. I was pretty good. Mind if I join you next week? No one wants to say 'yes', but they're on the spot.  Finally, one man says, Okay, but we start at 6:30 a.m.He figures the early tee-time will discourage her.The woman says this may be a problem and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late.They roll their eyes, but say, Okay.She's there at 6:30 am. sharp and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round.She's fun and pleasant and the guys are impressed.They congratulate her and invite her back the next week.She smiles, and says, I'll be there at 6:30, or 6:45.The next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp.Only this time, she plays left-handed.The three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand.They're totally amazed.They can't figure her out.She's very pleasant and a gracious winner.They invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.The third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys.This week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them.The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part.However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.This woman is a riddle no one can figure out.They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse and finally, one of the men asks her, How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?The lady blushes, and grins. When my dad taught me to play golf, I learned that I was ambidextrous. she replies. I like to switch back and forth.When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him.	If his willie points to the right, I golf right-handed; if it points to the left, I golf left-handed.The guys think this is hysterical.Astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys says, What if it's pointing straight up?She says, Then, I'm fifteen minutes late.

Stoner Joke. Three Men Died and Went to Hell Where They Met the Devil. (Warning! Long one) Three men died and went to hell where they met the Devil. The Devil told them that they had sinned in life and therefore had to spend the next 666 years in hell to atone for their sins. However, since the Devil wasn't entirely merciless, he would let them choose for themselves how they were going to spend those 666 years. And so the Devil let the men to three doors.Going through the first door, they entered what looked to be a normal bar. Although, if you were there for more than an hour, you would notice that no matter how much you tried to drink another bottle would appear on the shelf. And even better, the bar always had the exact drink you wanted available. An unlimited supply of every alcoholic beverage in existence. It was, in short, a drunkard's paradise.When they entered the second door, they were greeted by a myriad of women all ready to satisfy every sexual desire they could possible have. There were multiple women of every shape, size and ethnicity imaginable. Looking closer you would notice that there were even celebrity and work crushes from your life in the crowd. Every single one of them ready  to please you. It was, in short, a pervert's paradiseFinally, when they entered the third door, they found themselves in a forest made of cannabis. The ground was made of kief, all the bushes wore beatiful buds and even the trees were 20 feet tall cannabis plants. There were every strain it has or ever will be possible to grow. You could even find rocks of hashish laying around the forest floor if you looked closely. It was, in short, a stoner's paradise.The Devil asked the men which room they each wanted. The words had barely left the Devil's mouth before the first man ran directly to the room with a myriad of women. The second man then went to the room with the bar, thinking that if he was going to spend 666 years in hell, he might as well be drunk for most of it. Lastly, the third man, thinking he had won the lottery, gladly went towards the room with the forest of cannabis.666 years later, the Devil returned to see if the men had atoned for their sins.When he opened the first door, bottles slowly rolled out and you could immediately smell piss and puke coming from the room. It took the Devil a while, but he finally found the man nestled between the bottles, smeared in his own shit and puke, and with arguably the worst hangover in history. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.When he opened the second door, he was overwhelmed with the sound of hundreds of crying children and angry women. Not ten seconds after the door opened, the man came running, pleading for the Devil to please let him out. There were kids of every age running around screaming and all the women were angry at each other, while everyone, children and mothers alike, were angry at the man. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.When the Devil opened the third door, he immediately saw the man sitting cross legged in a giant pool of his own tears. The Devil had not expected this. Confused, he went to ask the man what was wrong.	The man, tears still running down his face, looked up at the Devil and said:I don't have a lighter

He floored it to 140 , then 150, then 155, and 160…Suddenly he thought, Shit man, I'm too old for this nonsense! So he pulled over to the side of the road and waited for the cop to catch up with him.

Three girls all worked in the same office with the same female boss. Each day, they noticed the boss left work early. One day, the girls decided that, when the boss left, they would leave right behind her. After all, she never called or came back to work, so how would she know if they went home early? The brunette was thrilled to be home early. She did a little gardening, spent playtime with her son, and went to bed early. The redhead was elated to be able to get in a quick workout at the spa before meeting a dinner date. The blonde was happy to get home early and surprise her husband, but when she got to her bedroom, she heard a muffled noise from inside. Slowly and quietly, she cracked open the door and was mortified to see her husband in bed with her boss! Gently she closed the door and crept out of her house. The next day, at their coffee break,the brunette and redhead planned to leave early again,and they asked the blonde if she was going to go with them. No way, the blonde exclaimed.	I almost got caught yesterday.
A married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine that would transfer a portion of the mother's labor pain to the father. He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it.The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine.The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him. The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain.	She and her husband were ecstatic.When they got home, the mailman was dead on the porch.

By following her, he found out she was working in a whore house.The guy says to the cabbie, Wanna make a $100?The cabbie says, Sure, what do I have to do?The guy replies that all the cabbie has to do is go inside the whore house, grab his wife, put her in the back of the cab, and take them home.The cabbie goes in. A couple of minutes later, the whore house door gets kicked open, and the cabbie starts dragging out this woman who is kicking, biting, punching, and fighting all the way to the cab.The cabbie opens the door to the cab, throws the girl inside, and tells the man, Here!

An easy question to Albert Einstein! One day, Einstein has to speak at an important science conference.On the way there, he tells his driver that looks a bit like him: I'm sick of all these conferences. I always say the same things over and over!The driver agrees: You're right. As your driver, I attended all of them, and even though I don't know anything about science, I could give the conference in your place. That's a great idea! says Einstein. Let's switch places then! So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it. But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.	The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says : Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.

The year is 1804 and a young man enlists on a ship.. ..his first voyage is to last 3 years, and even though the work is hard the young man takes to it like a fish in water.After only a few days he is running the riggin like an old hand, he swabs the decks without complaint and spends his free time in amicable companionship playing cards or telling tall tales.All in all the young man feels as if he has found his calling.A few weeks go by like this, the young man loving his new life except one part.. There are no women.After a couple of months like this, he is starting to feel extremely uncomfortable with the situation and voices his complaints to his shipmates one evening.Why don't you just use the barrel? Asks one of his mates with a surprised look .It turns out that down in the hold, in a dark corner there is a barrel, with a hole drilled into the side.. Whenever the sailors start to feel their urges rise, they simply go down to the barrel and take care of their business there.The young man decides, with some scepticism, to try the barrel, and finds to his surprise that it is a wholly pleasant experience, in no way lesser than any he has had with real women before.With this new found release the young man starts to enjoy his work even more. His days continue as before, and his evenings are still spent in pleasant company, but a new addition to his routine is a nightly visit to the barrel.Another two months pass in this way and all is well, until one night as he gets up from his seat at the card table and announces that he is going to visit the barrel to his mates.A few chuckles greet this announcement and one of his friends asks Trying to get the final fun out of it eh?Final fun? Are we getting rid of the barrel?	The young man asks, worry playing over his face.Not at all mate, it's just that.. next month is your turn in the barrel.

[Serious] Just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive. A few days ago I was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.Here's the joke I told:What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.Obviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown?No, replied the guy.	He choked on a sock.

There was this tramp. One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.Coincidentally the father drives up. How can I ever thank you sir? he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.Ah, well... stammers the tramp, ... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.Oh dear, says the father, I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.No! No! says the tramp, Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.Ten pounds, thinks the tramp, I'm rich! I'm rich! and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. I'll have one holiday please!Ahem, which holiday would sir like? asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds, replies the tramp.TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds, says the girl incredulously.She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.Well you'll never believe it, she says to the tramp, back in the shop. I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.Yippee! exclaims the tramp, I'll take it!A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.Get off my ship ye dirty bum! shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.But I've got my ticket!, responds the tramp, super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!Well okay, says the captain, but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.Psst, says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6 pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3 deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.Sheer luxury! exclaimed the tramp, A room of my very own.I'm glad you like it, replies the captain, but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what a dive...!Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.That was amazing! exclaimed the captain, Where did you learn to dive like that?Um, well I've never actually dived before, replied the tramp.Well that's incredible! says the captain, I've never seen... He broke off. Hey, I've got an idea, he started again. How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!It's a deal! says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.Then one morning the captain comes to talk. Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.Okay, agreed the tramp.Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.Well, tramp, said the captain, shaking his hand, Let's see what you can do. And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...up and up...below him the ship grew smaller...on and on...past a solitary albatross...and still higher...till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...and on still further.../ till the ocean grew dim...and the earth itself...began to shrink...past our moon...and on...and Mars...and on...higher, and higher...through the asteroid belt...and on and on towards the diving board...past the outer planets, until...on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...he reached the board.He climbed on top and radioed the captain...and then....' '.. .. .he jumped.....:Slowly at first,:but speeding up,:::faster, and faster,:speeding past Pluto,:and the other outer planets,.........through the asteroid belt,past Mars,and the moon,faster,and faster,faster - ever faster,and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,faster, and faster,past the albatross,double-back somersault,and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,I CAN SEE HIM! yelled a passenger, LOOK!! !The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!DOWN!DOWN!THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!STILL DOWN...!DEEPER,DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,TILL.........SMASH!Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.Up and up, desperate, gasping...Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.HERO! WONDERFUL! AMAZING! GOOD SHOW THAT!And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.The tramp blushed.The captain went on, but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: Well you see...For me to tell you, I'll need $49.95The captain outrageously asked why.The tramp said The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes, As for cost, we selected initial values based upon data from the Open Beta and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch.

A politician dies. Instead of going straight to heaven or hell, a spirit appears to him. The spirit tells him that, rather than being judged for his sins, he gets to choose whether he goes to heaven or hell. The politician replies that of course he wants to go to heaven. The spirit tells him that before he chooses, he has to visit both places so each one will get a fair chance.First they visit heaven. It looks pretty nice. Big fluffy clouds, angels singing and playing harps, everyone seeming to enjoy themselves. The politician is pleased, if a bit underwhelmed.Hell, on the other hand, is magnificent. It’s the most beautiful place the politician has ever seen, and everyone there is having the time of their lives. It has a buffet table filled with delicious-smelling food, a beautiful garden, a pool with a water slide, a dance floor, a massage parlor, and innumerable other attractions. It makes heaven look dull and boring and comparison.I can’t believe I’m saying this, says the politician, but I think I’d rather go to hell! Very well, says the spirit. Turn around.When the politician turns around, though, hell appears to be completely different than it had been less than a minute ago. All of the attractions are gone, everything is on fire, and the people are screaming in agony.I don’t understand! cries the politician. This isn’t what you showed me before!Well, that was the campaign, replies the spirit.	Now you’ve voted.

The Jones didn't have any children and decided to use a proxy father to start their family. On the day the proxy father was to arrive, Mr. Jones kissed his wife and said, I'm off, honey. The man should be here soon. Half an hour later, a door-to-door baby photographer rang the doorbell with the hopes of making a sale.Good morning madam. You don't know me but I've come to.....Oh, there's no need to explain. I've been expecting you, Mrs. Jones cut in.You have? the photographer asked. Well, good! I've made a specialty of babies.That's exactly what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat. Just where do we start? asked a blushing Mrs. Jones.You just leave everything to me, he replied. Usually, I try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. Sometimes the living room floor is fun too; you can really spread out.Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work for George and me, stated Mrs. Jones.Well, madam, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. However, if we try several different positions, and I shoot from five or six angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.I certainly hope we can get this over with quickly, gasped Mrs. Jones.Madam, in my line of work, a man must take his time. I would love to be in and out in five minutes, but you'd be disappointed with that, I'm sure.Don't I know! exclaimed Mrs. Jones.The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures.

Some clocks are moving rather slowly, while others go a full circle in less than ten seconds. The man asks one of the angels there about the strange wall. The angel responds:Each clock in this room represents a country back on Earth.

The bigger the country the bigger the clock.Intrigued by this, the man seeks out the clock of his own country, Canada. And what do you know, there it is, going forward one step at a time.

As a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: 5 lamb chops, please.  Amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop.

Nope. Frustrated, Robert stormed off into the bathroom, undressed and walked back into the kitchen completely naked except for the boots. Again he asked Margaret, a little louder this time, notice anything different now? Margaret looked up and said in her best deadpan, Robert, what's different? It's hanging down today, it was hanging down yesterday, it'll be hanging down again tomorrow. Furious, Robert yelled, and do you know why it's hanging down, Margaret? Nope. Not a clue, she replied. It's hanging down, because it's looking at my new boots!!!! Without missing a beat Margaret replied, should have bought a hat, Robert!	Should have bought a hat.

They knew what a new F150 cost.Well, he says, this one cost me just fifteen dollars. The father looks at him like he's crazy. Who would sell a truck like that for fifteen dollars? he says.It was the lady up the street, says the boy. I don't know her name - they just moved in. She saw me ride past on my bike and asked me if I wanted to buy her F150 for fifteen dollars.Oh my Goodness! says the mother. Maybe she's mentally ill or has Alzheimer's something.

But after 50, her breasts become like onions.The son is confused and asks, Onions?The father replies, Yes, you see them and they make you cry.The wife and daughter are really annoyed by what their father has said, so the daughter asks, Mom, how many different kinds of penises are there?The mother smiles and says, Well honey, a man also goes through three phases in life too. In his 20s, his willy is like an oak tree, mighty, strong and hard. In his 30s and 40s, it becomes more like a birch, flexible but reliable.

There was this tramp. One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.Coincidentally the father drives up. How can I ever thank you sir? he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.Ah, well... stammers the tramp, ... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.Oh dear, says the father, I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.No! No! says the tramp, Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.Ten pounds, thinks the tramp, I'm rich! I'm rich! and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. I'll have one holiday please!Ahem, which holiday would sir like? asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds, replies the tramp.TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds, says the girl incredulously.She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.Well you'll never believe it, she says to the tramp, back in the shop. I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.Yippee! exclaims the tramp, I'll take it!A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.Get off my ship ye dirty bum! shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.But I've got my ticket!, responds the tramp, super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!Well okay, says the captain, but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.Psst, says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6 pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3 deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.Sheer luxury! exclaimed the tramp, A room of my very own.I'm glad you like it, replies the captain, but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what a dive...!Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.That was amazing! exclaimed the captain, Where did you learn to dive like that?Um, well I've never actually dived before, replied the tramp.Well that's incredible! says the captain, I've never seen... He broke off. Hey, I've got an idea, he started again. How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!It's a deal! says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.Then one morning the captain comes to talk. Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.Okay, agreed the tramp.Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.Well, tramp, said the captain, shaking his hand, Let's see what you can do. And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...up and up...below him the ship grew smaller...on and on...past a solitary albatross...and still higher...till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...and on still further.../ till the ocean grew dim...and the earth itself...began to shrink...past our moon...and on...and Mars...and on...higher, and higher...through the asteroid belt...and on and on towards the diving board...past the outer planets, until...on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...he reached the board.He climbed on top and radioed the captain...and then....' '.. .. .he jumped.....:Slowly at first,:but speeding up,:::faster, and faster,:speeding past Pluto,:and the other outer planets,.........through the asteroid belt,past Mars,and the moon,faster,and faster,faster - ever faster,and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,faster, and faster,past the albatross,double-back somersault,and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,I CAN SEE HIM! yelled a passenger, LOOK!! !The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!DOWN!DOWN!THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!STILL DOWN...!DEEPER,DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,TILL.........SMASH!Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.Up and up, desperate, gasping...Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.HERO! WONDERFUL! AMAZING! GOOD SHOW THAT!And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.The tramp blushed.The captain went on, but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: Well you see...For me to tell you, I'll need $49.95The captain outrageously asked why.The tramp said The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes, As for cost, we selected initial values based upon data from the Open Beta and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch.

While riding my motorbike, I swerved to avoid hitting a deer, lost control and landed in a ditch, severely banging my head.Dazed and confused I crawled out of the ditch to the edge of the road when a shiny new convertible pulled up with a very beautiful woman who asked, Are you okay?As I looked up, I noticed she was wearing a low-cut blouse with cleavage to die for...I'm okay I think, I replied as I pulled myself up to the side of the car to get a closer look.She said, Get in and I’ll take you home, so I can clean and bandage that nasty scrape on your head.That's nice of you, I answered, but I don't think my wife will like me doing that!Oh, come now, I’m a nurse, she insisted. I need to see if you have any more scrapes and then treat them properly.Well, she was pretty and very persuasive. Being sort of shaken and weak, I agreed, but repeated, I'm sure my wife won't like this.We arrived at her place which was just few miles away and, after a couple of cold beers and the bandaging, I thanked her and said, I feel a lot better, but I know my wife is going to be really upset so I'd better go now.Don't be silly! she said with a smile. Stay for a while. She won't know anything.	By the way, where is she?Still in the ditch with the motorbike, I guess.

Trump replied, I seriously doubt that. With one little wave of your hand? Show me!	So the Pope slapped him

Before I called her back my aunt called, told me that my cousin was lying and not to give her the money.

When Beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard. A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried. Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards.He listened a while longer, and said, There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling. So the magistrate kept listening; There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about.	It's just Beethoven decomposing.

Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community... If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each otherThe Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.The Rabbi pulled out an apple.With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue! 'Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.	'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'

Finally the man finds a tiny planet with the surface area of a football pitch. He sets foot on it when a tree ambushes him.Hello, will you take me to earth? The tree asks.Sure. The man says.You're a great dude so I'll grant you one wish. The tree promises.Could you make me a watch that measures time 100% accurately wherever I am? The man asks.Do you realise how advanced that technology would need to be. It would need to take into account relativity, gravity, your velocity and tons of other factors. The tree moans.Ok, can you stop people reposting on r/jokes whilst only changing the setup? The man says.What kind of watch again?	The tree asks.

And she noticed... What's wrong? Scarlett Johansson asked, Nothing... the guy would say...She pestered him for a while eventually saying she would do ANYTHING he needed or wanted to make him feel good again, just because she really cared for him a lot, and even if he wasn't asking, she felt it was the least she owed it to him...Really?, you'll do anything I'd like?yes she said anything!ok, first i want you to take off you toga and get into this pair of work jeans that somehow washed on the shoreok...now put this shirt on please, but first, tape your boobs so they are flatwha... ok, I'd say I'd do anything she said lovingly.ok, now, take this hat and wear it, but tuck your hair under itShe was kinda confused, but non the less, she wanted to make him happy, so she tucked her hair under the hat.Now id like for you to grab this piece of soot and paint yourself a beard and a mustacheok... if this is what you want... she muttered.now, please, put on these sunglasses, and start walking down the beach I'll catch up to you in a bit, he said a bit excited...She started walking... wondering... doubting herself... just confused about what had just happened, maybe it wasn't her, maybe it was h... suddenly the guy grabs her by her shoulder turns her around and says: DUDE!!!	you won't believe who I've been fucking for the past 6 months!

Balls.. A big Texan stopped at a local restaurant following a day roaming around in Mexico. While sipping his tequila, he noticed a sizzling, scrumptious looking platter being served at the next table. Not only did it look good, but the smell was wonderful. He asked the waiter, What is that you just served? The waiter replied, Ah, Señor, you have excellent taste! Those are called Cojones de Toro, bull's testicles from the bull fight this morning. A real delicacy! The cowboy said, What the heck, bring me an order. The waiter replied, I am so sorry, Señor. There is only one serving per day because there is only one bull fight each morning. If you come early and place your order, we will be sure to save you this delicacy. The next morning, the cowboy returned, placed hisorder, and that evening was served the one and only special delicacy of the day. After a few bites, inspecting his platter, he called to the waiter and said, These are delicious, but they are much, much smaller than the ones I saw you serve yesterday. The waiter shrugged his shoulders and replied, Si, Señor.	Sometimes the bull wins.

The Hawaiian monk asks.Sure, what do you need? The man replies. The monk tells him of a hidden temple in the desert. So the man hires a private jet and flies into the desert where he meets a sphinx. The sphinx asks him a riddle.What walks on four legs in the morning, two in the afternoon and three in the evening? After 13 hours the man figures out the answer, a human. The sphinx leads him to the temple.

Finally the man finds a tiny planet with the surface area of a football pitch. He sets foot on it when a tree ambushes him.Hello, will you take me to earth? The tree asks.Sure. The man says.You're a great dude so I'll grant you one wish. The tree promises.Could you make me a watch that measures time 100% accurately wherever I am? The man asks.Do you realise how advanced that technology would need to be. It would need to take into account relativity, gravity, your velocity and tons of other factors. The tree moans.Ok, can you stop people reposting on r/jokes whilst only changing the setup? The man says.What kind of watch again?	The tree asks.

They both met with an angel to find out if they would be admitted to Heaven.The angel said: Unfortunately, there's only one space available in Heaven today so I must decide which one of you will be admitted.The angel asked Stormy if there was some particular reason why she should go to Heaven. Stormy took off her top and said: Look at these, they're the most perfect breasts God ever created and I'm sure it will please God to be able to see them every day,for eternity.The angel thanked Stormy, and asked Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the same question.The Queen walked over to a toilet, pulled the lever and flushed it without saying a word.The Angel immediately said: Okay, your Majesty, you may go into Heaven.Stormy was outraged and asked, What was that all about? I showed you two of God's own perfect creations and you turned me down. She simply flushed a commode and she got admitted to Heaven!	Would you explain that to me?Sorry, Stormy, said the Angel, but even in Heaven, a royal flush beats a pair, no matter how big they are.

A gorilla walks into a bar. A gorilla goes into a bar and orders a martini. This totally amazes the bartender, but he thinks, What the heck, I guess I might as well make the drink. So he mixes the martini. He then walks back over to the give it to the gorilla, and the animal is holding out a twenty-dollar bill. Well, now the bartender is just at a loss for words. He can't believe that a gorilla walked into his bar, ordered a martini, and then actually had a twenty-dollar bill to pay for it. So, in amazement, he takes the twenty and walks to the cash register to make the change. While he's standing in front of the cash register he stops for a second and thinks to himself, Let me try something here and see if the gorilla notices anything. So he walks back over to the gorilla and hands him a dollar change. The gorilla doesn't say anything, he just sits there sipping the martini. After a few minutes the bartender just can't take it anymore. You know, he says to the gorilla, we don't get too many gorillas in here.

Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community... If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each otherThe Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.The Rabbi pulled out an apple.With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue! 'Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.	'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'

A married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine that would transfer a portion of the mother's labor pain to the father. He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it.The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine.The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him. The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain.	She and her husband were ecstatic.When they got home, the mailman was dead on the porch.
Three men, Joe, Bro, and Buddy, all lived in a small town. One day, Joe went hunting alone, and for the next few days no one heard from him. About a week afterwards, a body was found and brought into the coroner’s office. The coroner, after thoroughly examining the body, needed a positive identification in order to verify that the body was indeed Joe. So, he brought in Bro and Buddy, and told them to come in separately to identify the body. Bro came in first, and was asked to look for any details about the body that he recognized. After a few minutes of examining, Bro said, Mr. Coroner, I’ll need you to turn the body over for me to be sure.Confused, the coroner obliged. Bro continued to examine the body, bent down on one knee, reared his head sideways, then stood up and said, No sir, this can’t be Joe.The coroner was even more confused, but he accepted this statement and sent Bro out. Next, he invited Buddy in to repeat the task. Buddy, after examining the body in a similar fashion to Bro, also requested that the body be turned over.The coroner, after mumbling a bit about his confusion, flipped the body over. Buddy too bent down on one knee and examined the back area of the body, then, just as Bro had previously, said, No sir, Mr. Coroner, this isn’t Joe.The coroner was astonished, so he asked that Bro come back in so that the two of them were standing there at once. The coroner said, Gentlemen, this man’s dental records and features match perfectly with those of your friend Joe’s. How on earth are you both positive this isn’t him?Bro and Buddy looked at each other, then Bro answered, Sir, this can’t be Joe because Joe has two assholes.In shock, the coroner asked, How can he have two assholes? Have you ever seen them?Buddy replied, No sir, but it was common knowledge. Every time we were out with him, people would say, ‘Look, it’s Joe with those two assholes!’**Credit goes to my grandmother, who was the first to tell me this joke.	**

Two 90 year old men, Mike and Joe, have been friends all of their lives. When it's clear that Joe is dying, Mike visits him every day. One day Mike says, Joe, we both loved football all our lives, and we played football on Saturdays together for so many years. Please do me one favour, when you get to Heaven, somehow you must let me know if there's football there.Joe looks up at Mike from his death bed, Mike, you've been my best friend for many years. If it's at all possible, I'll do this favour for you.Shortly after that, Joe passes on.At midnight a couple of nights later, Mike is awakened from a sound sleep by a blinding flash of white light and a voice calling out to him, Mike--Mike.Who is it? asks Mike sitting up suddenly. Who is it?Mike--it's me, Joe.You're not Joe. Joe just died.I'm telling you, it's me, Joe, insists the voice.Joe! Where are you?In heaven, replies Joe. I have some really good news and a little bad news.Tell me the good news first, says Mike.The good news, Joe says, is that there's football in heaven. Better yet, all of our old friends who died before us are here, too. Better than that, we're all young again. Better still, it's always spring time and it never rains or snows. And best of all, we can play football all we want, and we never get tired.That's fantastic, says Mike. It's beyond my wildest dreams!	So what's the bad news?You're on the team for this Saturday's match!

A man escapes from a prison where he's been locked up for 15 years. He breaks into a house to look for money and guns. Inside, he finds a young couple in bed. He orders the guy out of bed and ties him to a chair. While tying the homeowner's wife to the bed, the convict gets on top of her, kisses her neck, then gets up and goes into the bathroom. While he's in there, the husband whispers over to his wife: Listen, this guy is an escaped convict. Look at his clothes! He's probably spent a lot of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in years. I saw how he kissed your neck. If he wants sex, don't resist, don't complain... do whatever he tells you. Satisfy him no matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is obviously very dangerous. If he gets angry, he'll kill us both. Be strong, honey. I love you! His wife responds: He wasn't kissing my neck. He was whispering in my ear.

There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living... There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.The man was perfectly fine.Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just a bad conductor.

Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community... If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each otherThe Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.The Rabbi pulled out an apple.With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue! 'Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.	'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'

A perfectly triangular lake has 3 kingdoms on its 3 sides. . The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.	And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.
[Serious] Just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive. A few days ago I was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.Here's the joke I told:What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.Obviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown?No, replied the guy.	He choked on a sock.

An 18 year old Italian girl tells her Mom that she has missed her period for two months.......  Very worried, the mother goes to the drugstore and buys a pregnancy kit.

A mature and distinguished man with gray hair and impeccably dressed in an Armani suit steps out of the of the Ferrari and enters the house.He sits in the living room with the father, mother, and the girl and tells them: Good morning, your daughter has informed me of the problem. I can't marry her because of my personal family situation but I'll take charge. I will pay all costs and provide for your daughter for the rest of her life. Additionally, if a girl is born, I will bequeath a Ferrari, a beach house, two retail stores, a townhouse, a beachfront villa, and a $2,000,000 bank account.

However, if there is a miscarriage, what do you suggest I do?At this point, the father, who had remained silent, places a hand firmly on the man's shoulder and tells him, You fuck her again.

Jesus and Moses are golfing in a threesome. Moses tees off first and uncorks a high sailing slice. The ball plops into the middle of a lake. Unperturbed, Moses walks to the edge of the lake, raises his club, and the waters part. Moses chips onto the green. Jesus tees off next. He blades a worm-burner that heads for the lake, skipping thrice and coming to rest on top of the water. Jesus walks out onto the water and chips onto the green. The third gentlemen hooks the everliving shit out of the ball. It goes into the road, gets hit by a car, ricochets across the fairway to the lake, is gobbled up by a frog, who is snatched by a stork. As the stork flies over the green, the frog spits out the ball, which rolls into the cup.	Moses turns to Jesus and says:  I hate playing with your Dad.

This is a mean joke. A physicist, an engineer, and a statistician go on a hunting trip, they are walking through the woods when they spot a deer in a clearing. The physicist calculates the distance of the target, the velocity and drop of the bullet, adjusts his rifle and fires, missing the deer 5 feet to the left. The engineer rolls his eyes. 'You forgot to account for wind. Give it here', he snatches the rifle, licks his finger and estimates the speed and direction of the wind and fires, missing the deer 5 feet to the right.	Suddenly, the statistician claps his hands and yells We got him!

Arthur is 75 years old. He’s played golf every day since his retirement 15 years ago. One day he arrives home looking downcast. That’s it, he tells his wife. I’m giving up golf. My eyesight has become so bad that once I hit the ball I couldn’t see where it went. His wife sympathises and makes him a cup of tea. As they sit down she says, Why don’t you take my brother with you and give it one more try.That’s no good, sighs Arthur, your brother is 85. He can’t help.He may be 85, says the wife, but his eyesight is perfect.So the next day Arthur heads off to the golf course with his brother-in-law. He tees up, takes a mighty swing and squints down the fairway. He turns to the brother-in-law and says, Did you see the ball?Of course I did! Answers the brother-in-law. I have perfect eyesight.Where did it go?	Arthur asks.I don’t remember.

A farmer has 895 sheep. Realising that this is quite a lot of sheep for one farm, and Jess the sheepdog is getting a bit old, he decides he'll probably need a new dog- no, a whole team of dogs- to round so many sheep up.So the next day, the farmer goes to the pet store. He looks around at the various herding dogs- they seem very fit, but young and untrained. The shopkeeper asks the farmer if he wants any help.Why yes, says the farmer. I need a team of sheepdogs to help round up my flock. I have a rather large number of sheep, you see, and I don't think any of these young pups would be up to the task of rounding up so many.The shopkeeper says, I've got just the thing for you. and leads the farmer into a small back room, where a single sheepdog sits waiting.Are you sure? asks the farmer, I have very many sheep and I don't think one dog will be able to round all of them up..I'm sure. says the shopkeeper, This is a very intelligent dog. He's been well-trained for many jobs and has skills beyond any other dog I've ever seen.Yes, says the dog, I know six languages, eight martial arts and I have a degree in engineering.The farmer, clearly very impressed by this dog- who wouldn't be impressed by that?- decides to take him home.That afternoon, the farmer and the dog walk together up hill, and from the top they can see the entire flock covering the fields.Well, says the farmer, I'd like you to round up all of these sheep..Okay.	replies the dog, You have nine hundred sheep.

A journalist asked Tim Cook why iPhones are so expensive. Well, said Tim Cook, that's because the iPhone replaces a whole bunch of devices. A phone, a camera, a watch, a music player, a video player, a PDA, a voice recorder, a GPS navigator, a flashlight, a calculator, a portable gaming console, and many other things. Surely, a high price is worth paying to replace so many devices!Then why are Androids so much cheaper?, asked the journalist.Because, said Tim Cook, an Android replaces just one device.	The iPhone.

A professional gambler wins big and dies of an aneurysm. When he gets to the afterlife, he finds himself at the back of a miles-long line to get into Heaven.Drawing on his experience, the gambler immediately thinks of a way to get ahead of everyone else. He taps the old man ahead of him on the shoulder...Want to make a bet while we wait? The Gambler asks. If I can guess your last words in three tries, you have to let me cut ahead of you.The old man, having nothing better to do, agrees. Immediately, the gambler begins reading him like the pro player he is. He notices the elderly Asian man's shirt is open, exposing a pair of defibrillator marks.Don't be silly, it's just indigestion. the gambler remarks. The old man looks a bit surprised, then steps aside, giving up his place in line.Next, the gambler taps on a redneck's shoulder. He makes the same bet, and the redneck also accepts.This one's easy! the gambler smirks, sizing up the bruised, bloody, grass stained redneck with the caved in skull. Hold my beer!Muttering profanities, the redneck begrudgingly steps aside and gives up his place in line.Riding the high of a hot streak, the gambler wastes no time tapping the next man ahead of him on the shoulder. He quickly makes the same bet, and is ecstatic when the agreement is made.Okay, let's see... The gambler studies the new mark carefully. He's a large, imposing black man riddled with several bullet holes.The gambler holds his hand out like a gun. You ain't taking me alive!The man shakes his head. Wrong. The gambler strokes his chin. The guy is giving him nothing else to work with.The gambler holds the 'gun' sideways, makes a mean face, and shouts, Fuck the police!Wrong again. The gambler's getting frustrated, now. He's never been unable to read someone before.Finally, the gambler throws his hands in the air. I'VE GOT NOTHING! He shouts.	I GIVE UP!The man steps aside.

A husband notices his wife’s hearing is deteriorating and decides to visit her doctor for advice. I can’t speak to my wife directly as she might find it offensive, given our old age he says to the doc. There’s a simple trick you can try to determine her hearing explains the doctor.

He thinks to himself, what a perfect opportunity to test her hearing. He stands in the doorway of the kitchen and promptly asks;What’s for dinner honey?No answer. He moves closer. What’s for dinner honey?Still no answer. He moves even closer. What’s for dinner honey?Still his wife doesn’t answer. He now sees how serious her hearing problem is. At this point, he is stood right next to his wife.	What’s for dinner honey?FOR THE FOURTH FUCKING TIME WE’RE HAVING CHICKEN

He points out that the man does look good in the black suit he is already wearing.The widow, however, says that she always thought her husband looked his best in blue, and that she wants him in a blue suit. She gives the mortician a blank check and says, I don't care what it costs, but please have my husband in a blue suit for the viewing.The woman returns the next day for the wake. To her delight, she finds her husband dressed in a gorgeous blue suit with a subtle chalk stripe; the suit fits him perfectly.She says to the mortician, Whatever this cost, I'm very satisfied. You did an excellent job and I'm very grateful. How much did you spend?To her astonishment, the mortician presents her with the blank check.There's no charge, he says.No, really, I must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit! she says.Honestly, ma'am, the mortician says, it cost nothing. You see, a deceased gentleman of about your husband's size was brought in shortly after you left yesterday, and he was wearing an attractive blue suit.	I asked his wife if she minded him going to his grave wearing a black suit instead, and she said it made no difference as long as he looked nice.Then it was just a matter of switching the heads
A German, a Frenchman and an Englishman go fishing... They fish quite happily for a while until the German catches a huge golden fish, but as he pulls it off the hook it says Please don't kill me! Spare my life and I'll grant you all a wish!The German throws the fish back and says I wish for a mug of beer that will never empty, and immediately a foaming mug of ice-cold German ale appears in his hand. He takes a long swig and when he puts it down, it's still miraculously full! The Frenchman and Englishman are, of course, amazed.I wish, said the Frenchman, For a wall to be built around France, ten miles high and ten miles thick, so that nobody can get in and nobody can get out.The fish screws up its eyes in concentration for a moment then says. Done! And what do you want?Is there a wall around France? asks the EnglishmanYes.	replies the fish.Is it ten miles high and ten miles thick?Yes.And can nobody get in, and nobody get out?Yes.Well then, says the Englishman, I want you to fill it with water.

An engineer dies, and by some mistake he is sent to hell. Satan was unsure of why the engineer was sent down there, but he might as well be of use. He commissioned the engineer to install AC, plumbing, various water features, and many other amenities that really started to turn hell into a pretty decent place.God, on the other hand, took notice of what was taking place and was furious. He demanded to speak with Satan.Why do you have this man when he lived righteously and has a place in heaven?	God bellowed.I don't know, but I'm keeping him, Satan snarkily replied.You will hand him over now, God said ferociously, or else I will sue you!Satan smirked.Where you gonna get a lawyer?

A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up. So, he opens the box and picks up the letter. He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters. When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail. He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it. The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter. *Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, Ding-dong. *The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.Pardon me, sir, the mailman says, but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.Ah, my letter. Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated. Please do so again replies the Buddhist monk.But sir, says mailman, you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.But that is my intention, dear man, replies the Buddhist monk.	You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.

Unbutton my blouse.. A successful rancher died and left everything to his devoted wife. She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand... Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk. She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.. For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well. Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels. The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night. One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return. Two o'clock and no hired hand. Finally he returned around two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him. She quietly called him over to her.. Unbutton my blouse and take it off, she said. Trembling, he did as she directed. Now take off my boots. He did as she asked, ever so slowly.. Now take off my socks. He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots. Now take off my skirt. He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light. Now take off my bra.. Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.	Then she looked at him and said, If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired.

Joe was moderately successful in his career, but as he got older he was increasingly hampered by incredible headaches. When his personal hygiene and love life started to suffer, he sought medical help. After being referred from one specialist to another, he finally came across a doctor who solved the problem. The good news is I can cure your headaches; the bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press up against the base of your spine. The pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles. Joe was shocked and depressed, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife. After the operation, his mind was clear, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. He walked past a men's clothing store and thought, That's what I need, a new suit. He entered the shop and told the salesman, I'd like a new suit. The salesman eyed him briefly and said, Let's see, size 44 long? Joe laughed, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. replied the salesman. Joe tried on the suit, and it fit him perfectly. As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, How about a new shirt? Joe thought for a moment and then said, Sure!. The salesman eyed Joe, then said, Let's see, 34 sleeve and 16 and a half neck.. Joe was surprised, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. came the familiar reply. Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly, as well. The salesman asked, How about new shoes?. Joe was on a roll and agreed. The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, Let's see, nine-and-a-half? Joe was astonished, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. said the salesman, again. Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly, again. He walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, How about some new underwear? Joe thought for a second and said, Sure, why not. The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, Let's see, size 36. Joe laughed smugly, No, I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old. The shocked salesman shook his head, You can't possibly wear a size 34!	It would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache.

I took my daughter out for her first drink... While reading an article about fathers and sons drinking together, I remembered the time I took my daughter out for her first drink. Off we went to our local bar only two blocks from the house. I got her a Guinness. She didn't like it, so I drank it. Then I got her a Killian's she didn't like that either, so I drank it. Finally, I thought she might like some Harp Lager? She didn't. I drank it. I thought maybe she'd like whiskey better than beer so we tried a Jameson's; nope! In desperation, I had her try that 25 year old Glenfiddich. The bar's finest scotch. She wouldn't even smell it. What could I do but drink it!

Scotsman, Englishman, and an Irishman walk into a bar. Sitting in a bar the Scotsman says, As good as this bar is, I still prefer the pubs back home. In Glasgow, there's a wee place.

The next morning he only had 401 dollars left. He went to the market and was able to buy a strong, young bull with the 400 dollars.

As a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: 5 lamb chops, please.  Amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop. He follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and trot across the road to a bus-stop. The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench. When a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus. The butcher follows, dumbstruck. As the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery. After awhile he stands on his back paws to push the stop bell, then the butcher follows him off. The dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step. He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door. He does this again and again. No answer. So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window, jumps off, and waits at the front door. A big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog. The butcher runs up and screams at the guy: What the hell are you doing? This dog's a genius! The owner responds, Genius, my ass.........	It's the second time this week he's forgotten his keys!

Dear, Dad.It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you.I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.I've been finding real passion with Stacy.She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes and because she is so much older than I am.But it's not only the passion, Dad.She's pregnant.Stacy said that we will be very happy.She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter.We share a dream of having many more children.Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone.We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better.She sure deserves it!Don't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself.Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.Love, your son, Joshua.P.S.	Dad, none of the above is true.I'm over at Jason's house.I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that's on the kitchen table.Call when it is safe for me to come home!

Donald Trump was visiting a primary school and he visited one of the classes. They were in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings. The teacher asked the President if he would like to lead the discussion on the word tragedy. So the illustrious leader asked the class for an example of a tragedy. One little boy stood up and offered: If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs over him and kills him, that would be a tragedy. No, said Trump, that would be an accident A little girl raised her hand: If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy. I’m afraid not, explained the president. That’s what we would call great loss. The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Trump searched the room. Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? Finally at the back of the room a small boy raised his hand... In a quiet voice he said: If ‘Air Force One’ was carrying you and was struck by a friendly fire missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy. Fantastic! exclaimed Trump. That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be tragedy?	Well, said the boy, It has to be a tragedy, because it certainly wouldn’t be a great loss, and it probably wouldn’t be a fucking accident either.

Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community... If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each otherThe Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.The Rabbi pulled out an apple.With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue! 'Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.	'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'

Inside the room you will find your wife sitting in a chair... we need you to kill her' The man said, 'You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife.' The agent said, 'Then you're not the right man for this job. Take your wife and go home.' The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. The man came out with tears in his eyes, 'I tried, but I can't kill my wife.' The agent said, 'You don't have what it takes. Take your wife home.' Finally, the last man was given the same instructions, to kill his wife. He took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the man, wiping the sweat from his brow. 'Some idiot loaded the gun with blanks' he said. 'I had to strangle that bitch to death'.	**

In a crowded city at a bus stop, a beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in a tight leather mini skirt, with matching tight leather boots and jacket... As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus. Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't! So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. With a coy little smile to the driver, she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step.About this time, a big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, How dare you touch my body!!	I don't even know who you are!At this, the Texan drawled, Well ma'am normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends.

Once upon a time there lived a beautiful Queen with large breasts. Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.The moral of the story - Pay your bills !	!

Donald Trump was visiting a primary school and he visited one of the classes. They were in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings.

One little boy stood up and offered: If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs over him and kills him, that would be a tragedy. No, said Trump, that would be an accident A little girl raised her hand: If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy. I’m afraid not, explained the president. That’s what we would call great loss. The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Trump searched the room. Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? Finally at the back of the room a small boy raised his hand... In a quiet voice he said: If ‘Air Force One’ was carrying you and was struck by a friendly fire missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy. Fantastic! exclaimed Trump. That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be tragedy?	Well, said the boy, It has to be a tragedy, because it certainly wouldn’t be a great loss, and it probably wouldn’t be a fucking accident either.

While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the situation to the principal. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave. She agreed.Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he happily agreed to take the test.Principal:  What is 3 x 3?Harry:  9.Principal:  What is 6 x 6?Harry:  36.And so it went with every question the principal thought a bright 3rd grader should know.The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, Y’know, I reckon Harry can go to the 3rd grade.But Ms. Brooks is still skeptical of the little bugger and says to the principal, Not so fast, let me ask him a few questions.The principal and Harry both agree. Ms. Brooks asks, What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?Harry, after a moment:  Legs.Ms. Brooks:  What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?The principal wondered why would she ask such a question!Harry replied:  Pockets. to the Principal’s great relief. Ms. Brooks:  What does a dog do that a man steps into?Harry:  Pants.By now, the principal is sitting forward with his mouth hanging open.Ms. Brooks:  What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?Now the principal's eyes open really wide and before he could intervene, Harry replied, Bubble gum.Ms. Brooks:  What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?Harry:  Shake hands.The principal is now trembling with apprehension as Ms. Brooks asks the last question.Ms.	Brooks:  What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' and indicates a great deal of heat and excitement?Harry: Firetruck.The principal breaths a huge sigh of relief and tells the teacher, Put the little bastard in 5th Grade; I got the last seven questions wrong myself.

The Italian Lover, a virile middle aged Italian gentlemen named Guido was relaxing at his favorite bar in Rome when he managed to attract a spectacular young blond woman.

This time she thrashed about wildly and there were screams of passion.It finally ended and, again, Guido smiled and asked, You finish?Again, after a short pause, she returned his smile, cuddled closer to him and softly said, No.Stunned, but damned if he was going to leave this woman unsatisfied, Guido reached for the woman yet again.Using the last of his strength, he barely managed it, but they ended together screaming, bucking, clawing and ripping the bed sheets.Exhausted, Guido fell onto his back, gasping. Barely able to turn his head, he looked into her eyes, smiled proudly and asked again, You finish?	?Barely able to speak, the beautiful blonde whispered in his ear… No, I Norwegian.
A politician dies. Instead of going straight to heaven or hell, a spirit appears to him. The spirit tells him that, rather than being judged for his sins, he gets to choose whether he goes to heaven or hell. The politician replies that of course he wants to go to heaven. The spirit tells him that before he chooses, he has to visit both places so each one will get a fair chance.First they visit heaven. It looks pretty nice. Big fluffy clouds, angels singing and playing harps, everyone seeming to enjoy themselves. The politician is pleased, if a bit underwhelmed.Hell, on the other hand, is magnificent. It’s the most beautiful place the politician has ever seen, and everyone there is having the time of their lives. It has a buffet table filled with delicious-smelling food, a beautiful garden, a pool with a water slide, a dance floor, a massage parlor, and innumerable other attractions. It makes heaven look dull and boring and comparison.I can’t believe I’m saying this, says the politician, but I think I’d rather go to hell! Very well, says the spirit. Turn around.When the politician turns around, though, hell appears to be completely different than it had been less than a minute ago. All of the attractions are gone, everything is on fire, and the people are screaming in agony.I don’t understand! cries the politician. This isn’t what you showed me before!Well, that was the campaign, replies the spirit.	Now you’ve voted.

The farmer and his wife needed a new bull... There was a man who lived on a farm with his wife in the middle of nowhere. All they owned was a truck, a few cows, and an old bull. They didn't have much, but they were happy. One day, the farmer woke up and found that the bull had died. He went to his wife and said, I take our money into the town and buy us a new bull. I know you need the truck here to keep the farm running, so when I get us a bull, I'll send you a telegraph so you know when to pick us up.His wife went and got the money and then said goodbye.The farmer arrived in town late that day and had to get a hotel room. The next morning he only had 401 dollars left. He went to the market and was able to buy a strong, young bull with the 400 dollars. It had been a long time since he had been to town, but as long as the telegraph prices hadn't gone up, he should be able to send a full sentence to his wife with his dollar.When he arrived at the post office, he said to the telegraph operator: I need to send a message to my wife so she can pick up my bull and I. How much is a word?Prices went up a few years ago, replied the operator. A word is 1 dollar.Oh no, said the farmer I can only send one word! He thought for a little while and then said, Ok, send my wife the word 'comfortable.'Comfortable? Are you sure? asked the operator.My wife has a 4th grade education, the farmer replied. When she reads she has to sound each word out syllable by syllable.	So when she sees the word comfortable, she'll read it as 'come-for-ta-bull.'

Last Name Only. The manager of a large office noticed a new man one day and told him to come into his office. What’s your name? he asked the new guy. John, the new guy replied.

An American soldier, serving in World War II, had just returned from several weeks of intense action on the German front lines. He had finally been granted R&R and was on a train bound for London. The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train, looking for an empty seat. The only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged lady and was being used by her little dog.The war weary soldier asked, Please, ma'am, may I sit in that seat? The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see my Little Fifi is using that seat? The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing the woman with the dog.Again he asked, Please, lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired. The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant.The soldier didnt say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.The woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your automobiles on the wrong side of the road.	And now, sir, you've thrown the wrong bitch out the window.

What starts with f and ends with k? A first-grade teacher, Ms. Brooks, was having trouble with one of her more precocious students. The teacher asked, Harry, what exactly is your problem?Harry answered, I'm too smart for the 1st grade. My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she! I think I should be in the 3rd grade, too!Ms. Brooks finally had enough; she took Harry to the principal's office. While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the situation to the principal. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave. She agreed.Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he happily agreed to take the test.Principal:  What is 3 x 3?Harry:  9.Principal:  What is 6 x 6?Harry:  36.And so it went with every question the principal thought a bright 3rd grader should know.The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, Y’know, I reckon Harry can go to the 3rd grade.But Ms. Brooks is still skeptical of the little bugger and says to the principal, Not so fast, let me ask him a few questions.The principal and Harry both agree. Ms. Brooks asks, What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?Harry, after a moment:  Legs.Ms. Brooks:  What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?The principal wondered why would she ask such a question!Harry replied:  Pockets. to the Principal’s great relief. Ms. Brooks:  What does a dog do that a man steps into?Harry:  Pants.By now, the principal is sitting forward with his mouth hanging open.Ms. Brooks:  What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?Now the principal's eyes open really wide and before he could intervene, Harry replied, Bubble gum.Ms. Brooks:  What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?Harry:  Shake hands.The principal is now trembling with apprehension as Ms. Brooks asks the last question.Ms.	Brooks:  What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' and indicates a great deal of heat and excitement?Harry: Firetruck.The principal breaths a huge sigh of relief and tells the teacher, Put the little bastard in 5th Grade; I got the last seven questions wrong myself.

A guy walks into a bar, followed by an ostrich, followed by a cat. All three sit down at the bar. The bartender looks at the man and says, What’ll ya have? The man says, Gimme a beer. The ostrich says, I’ll have one too. The cat says, I want two beers, but I’m only gonna pay half price. The bartender serves up four beers, and tells the man, that’ll be $12.67. The man reaches in his pocket and without even looking sets exact change down on the bar. After they finish their beers, the bartender asks, anything else? The man says, Gimme a shot of bourbon. The ostrich says, I’ll have one too. The cat says, I want a double bourbon, but I’m only gonna pay half price. The bartender serves them and says, That’s $14.03. The man reaches into his pocket and without even looking again sets exact change on the bar. After that round, the bartender says, What else will ya have? The man says, I need a Jack and Coke. The ostrich says, Me too! The cat says, I want two Jack and Cokes, and I’m only paying... Half price, I know, says the bartender. He sets them up and says, $16.38, please. The man reaches in his pocket a third time, and again sets exact change on the bar without counting it out. The bartender asks the man, How is it that every time you pay for your drink order, you can set exact change on the bar without looking? The man says, Well, some years ago I was walking on the beach in Egypt, and I found a magic lamp in the sand. I rubbed it, and a genie appeared and granted me three wishes for setting him free. So, with the first wish, I wished that no matter what I ever wanted to buy, I would always have exact change for it in my pocket.The bartender says, That’s brilliant! Most people would wish for a million or five million or whatever. This way, you’ll never run out of money, you don’t have to worry about carrying it, and you’ll never be robbed! Absolutely brilliant.The man says, I know, and thank you!The bartender says, So what did you ask for with your other two wishes?	The man said A chick with long legs and a tight pussy.
An HR manager was knocked down (tragically) by a bus and was killed. Her soul arrived at the Pearly Gates, where St.Peter welcomed her. Before you get settled in he said, We have a little problem…you see, we’ve never had a HR manager make it this far before and we’re not really sure what to do with you.Oh, I see, said the woman, can’t you just let me in?Well, I’d like to, said St Peter, But I have higher orders. We’re instructed to let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you’d like to go for all eternity.Actually, I think I’d prefer heaven, said the woman. Sorry, we have rules… at which St. Peter put the HR manager into the downward bound elevator.As the doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times.They played a perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed a superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had a wonderful night telling jokes and dancing.Before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. Now it’s time to spend a day in heaven, he said.So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day’s end St. Peter returned. So, he said, You’ve spent a day in hell and you’ve spent a day in heaven. You must choose between the two.The woman thought for a second and replied: Well, heaven is certainly lovely, but I actually had a better time in hell. I choose Hell.Accordingly, St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her.I don’t understand, stuttered the HR manager, The other day I was here, and there was a golf course, and a country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had a wonderful happy time.	Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.The Devil simply looked at her and smiled, Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you’re staff.

Once upon a time in an old magical kingdom, there lived an young monk called Sam... His order was renowned for their beautiful choralsinging. They trained, hours every day, refiningtheir voices and their art. Their song floateddown the mountainside, enriching the lives andsouls of the townspeople belowSam was particularly gifted, and on his 19thbirthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifullyintricate note of pure magic. Everyone withinmiles just froze in mid action, stirred to the verycore of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.And all the realm realized, instantly, that it wasSam, and Sam was the first person in historyto hit one of the rumored Magical Notes thatmusicians had theorized must exist... yet no onebefore Sam had ever reached one.And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.This time, the town below was so impactedthat no one moved, spoke, or even blink forseveral minutes after. As the golden sound finallytapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam hadfound the Second Note...And the next year on Sam's birthday, the townhad realized there was a pattern involved. Thistime, all of the townspeople were present in themonastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hitthe glorious Third Note. People cried out in purepurejoy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.Words cannot do justice to the experience. Thetown flourished, as Sam's notes made the peoplepure all the way to the core of their beings.And on it went for the next few years, the MagicalNotes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, thatis, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From thestart, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and thisnew sound was not beautiful... it was jarring anddiscordant. Sam started to get very warm, andwas visibly sweating onstage. He doubled hisresolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet partof the Magical Note that he knew must be there.Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneouslycombusted! The two closest monks on stagewere burned by the flames coming off of hisbody, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soonthe entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle,everyone made it out, except for poor SamThe townsfolk were left staring at the burningmonastery in sad, stunned disbelief.The mayor approached the lead monk of theorder. What happened? he asked, exasperatedThe old monk shook his head sadly. Isn't itobvious? he said.	Sam sung Note 7.PS : Not mine but the best I've ever heard !

The Hawaiian monk asks.Sure, what do you need? The man replies. The monk tells him of a hidden temple in the desert. So the man hires a private jet and flies into the desert where he meets a sphinx. The sphinx asks him a riddle.What walks on four legs in the morning, two in the afternoon and three in the evening? After 13 hours the man figures out the answer, a human. The sphinx leads him to the temple. As the man goes through the temple he has to kill hundreds of penguins but finally he makes it to the top floor where there is a red jewel.He picks up the jewel and a spaceship appears. Bored, the man gets into the spaceship and flies through the galaxy, exploring a ton of planets including Namek and Saturn. Finally the man finds a tiny planet with the surface area of a football pitch. He sets foot on it when a tree ambushes him.Hello, will you take me to earth? The tree asks.Sure. The man says.You're a great dude so I'll grant you one wish. The tree promises.Could you make me a watch that measures time 100% accurately wherever I am? The man asks.Do you realise how advanced that technology would need to be. It would need to take into account relativity, gravity, your velocity and tons of other factors. The tree moans.Ok, can you stop people reposting on r/jokes whilst only changing the setup? The man says.What kind of watch again?	The tree asks.

Two Canadians die and end up in Hell.  The devil decides to pay them a visit, so he walks into their room and sees them talking and laughing. Confused, he asks them why they're happy.They tell him, Well, we're so sick of the cold where we're from, and this place is nice and toasty.The devil, annoyed, storms away and goes to Hell's boiler room, where he turns up the temperature.

A businessman is getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knows his wife is always horny, so he decides to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn’t much like the idea of her screwing someone else. So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation, to the old man.Well, I don’t really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don’t know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except a... said the old man, and then he stopped.Except what? asked the businessman.Nothing, nothing, said the old man.C’mon, tell me! I need something! protested the businessman.Well, sir, I don’t usually mention this, but there is the ‘voodoo dildo,’ the old man said.The voodoo dildo? the businessman asked.The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!The old man said, But you haven’t seen what it’ll do yet.He pointed to a door and said Voodoo dildo, the door.The voodoo dildo rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, Voodoo dildo, box!The voodoo dildo stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, motionless.The businessman said, I’ll take it!The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, Voodoo dildo, my pussy.He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.After he’d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dildo. She lay down, placed the box between her legs, and said Voodoo dildo, my pussy! The voodoo dildo shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she’d ever experienced before.After three orgasms, she decided she’d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off! So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she’d had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn’t been drinking, but that a voodoo dildo was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn’t stop screwing her.The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, Yeah, right.	Voodoo dildo, my ass!
One day, Albert Einstein had to speak at an important science conference. On the way there, he tells his driver that looks a bit like him: I'm sick of all these conferences. I always say the same things over and over!The driver agrees: You're right. As your driver, I attended all of them, and even though I don't know anything about science, I could give the conference in your place. That's a great idea! says Einstein. Let's switch places then! So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it. But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.	The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says : Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.
An infinite number of mathematicians walk into a bar. The first mathematician orders a beerThe second orders half a beerI don't serve half-beers the bartender repliesExcuse me?

I couldn't serve you half a beer even if I wanted to.But that's not a problem mathematician #3 chimes in at the end of the joke you serve us a whole number of beers. You see, when you take the sum of a continuously halving function-I know how limits work interjects the bartenderOh, alright then.

FOR THE TAXPAYERS! and with that, they vanish.A nearby barfly stumbles over to the bartender. How did you know that that would work?It's simple really the bartender says.

Dave was bragging to his boss one day.  You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it. So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.No, no, just name anyone else, Dave says.President Trump, his boss quickly retorts.Yup, Dave says, Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington, and off they go.At the White House, Trump spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.Pope Francis, his boss replies.Sure! says Dave. I've known the Pope for years. So off they fly to Rome.Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.

Donald Trump was visiting a primary school and he visited one of the classes. They were in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings. The teacher asked the President if he would like to lead the discussion on the word tragedy. So the illustrious leader asked the class for an example of a tragedy. One little boy stood up and offered: If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs over him and kills him, that would be a tragedy. No, said Trump, that would be an accident A little girl raised her hand: If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy. I’m afraid not, explained the president. That’s what we would call great loss. The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Trump searched the room. Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? Finally at the back of the room a small boy raised his hand... In a quiet voice he said: If ‘Air Force One’ was carrying you and was struck by a friendly fire missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy. Fantastic! exclaimed Trump. That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be tragedy?	Well, said the boy, It has to be a tragedy, because it certainly wouldn’t be a great loss, and it probably wouldn’t be a fucking accident either.

A perfectly triangular lake has 3 kingdoms on its 3 sides. . The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.	And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

A guy walks into a restaurant with a full-grown ostrich behind him.  The waitress asks for their orders. The guy says, A hamburger, fries, and a coke, and turns to the ostrich, What's yours?I'll have the same, says the ostrich.A short time later the waitress returns with the order. That will be $18.40 please.

This becomes routine until one night they enter the restaurant and the waitress asks, The usual?No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato, and salad, says the guy.Me too, says the ostrich.The waitress brings the order and says, That will be $42.62.Once again the guy pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. The waitress can't hold back her curiosity any longer. Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?Well, says the guy, several years ago I was cleaning my attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it a genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.That's brilliant! says the waitress. Most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!That's right.	Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there, says the guy.The waitress asks, But, sir, what's with the ostrich?The guy sighs and answers, My second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who agrees with everything I say.

They knew what a new F150 cost.Well, he says, this one cost me just fifteen dollars. The father looks at him like he's crazy. Who would sell a truck like that for fifteen dollars? he says.It was the lady up the street, says the boy. I don't know her name - they just moved in. She saw me ride past on my bike and asked me if I wanted to buy her F150 for fifteen dollars.Oh my Goodness! says the mother. Maybe she's mentally ill or has Alzheimer's something. John, you better go see what's going on. So the boy's father walks up the street to the house where the lady lives and finds her out in the yard calmly planting petunias.He introduces himself as the father of the boy to whom she had sold a new Ford F150 truck for fifteen dollars and asks to know why she did it.Well, she says, two days ago my husband left on a business trip. Yesterday I got a phone call from his boss and found out that he really ran off to Hawaii with his secretary and doesn't intend to come back.Oh, my goodness, I'm so sorry, the father says. But what does that have to do with my son and your truck?Well, this morning he called and told me he was stranded because he got robbed of his wallet with all his credit cards and cash. He told me to sell his new F150 and send him the money.	So I did.
A new twist on an old joke. Scientists recently did a study on the effects the right side and left side of a brain had on counting.They first took out the left half of a man's brain and asked him to count to 10. He says, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.They put the left half back in and removed the right half, asking him to count to 10 again. He says 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.Finally they decided to just go for it and removed the whole brain. They again asked him to count to 10 one more time.He says, Look. I'm great at counting to 10, ok? I love numbers and I have the best numbers. No one has better numbers than I do. My 4th grade math teacher - and let me tell you, she was the best and smartest math teacher in the country at the time - my 4th grade math teacher said to me that I am the best counter she's ever seen. The best. So if you want me to count to 10, let me tell you I can count to 10 alright. That's no problem. I will do it. I will.	And I will do it better than any has ever done it before, ok?

All was quiet for about 5 minutes. The man came out with tears in his eyes, 'I tried, but I can't kill my wife.' The agent said, 'You don't have what it takes. Take your wife home.'

Once upon a time there lived a ravishing Queen with huge tits.. Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear.	The King immediately summoned Nick.

A coach is looking after a young ice hockey team. At one point during a game, the coach called one of his 7-year-old hockey players aside and asked, Do you understand what cooperation is? What a team is?The little boy nodded in the affirmative.Do you understand that what matters is not whether we win or lose, but how we play together as a team?The little boy nodded yes.So, the coach continued, I'm sure you know, when a penalty is called, you shouldn't argue, curse, attack the referee, or call him a pecker-head.Do you understand all that?Again the little boy nodded.He continued, And when I call you off the ice so that another boy gets a chance to play, it's not good sportsmanship to call your coach 'adumb a--hole', is it?Again the little boy nodded.Good, said the coach.	Now go over there and explain all that to your mother.

Unbutton my blouse.. A successful rancher died and left everything to his devoted wife. She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand... Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk. She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.. For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well. Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels. The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night. One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return. Two o'clock and no hired hand. Finally he returned around two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him. She quietly called him over to her.. Unbutton my blouse and take it off, she said. Trembling, he did as she directed. Now take off my boots. He did as she asked, ever so slowly.. Now take off my socks. He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots. Now take off my skirt. He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light. Now take off my bra.. Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.	Then she looked at him and said, If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired.

Stoner Joke. Three Men Died and Went to Hell Where They Met the Devil. (Warning! Long one) Three men died and went to hell where they met the Devil. The Devil told them that they had sinned in life and therefore had to spend the next 666 years in hell to atone for their sins. However, since the Devil wasn't entirely merciless, he would let them choose for themselves how they were going to spend those 666 years. And so the Devil let the men to three doors.Going through the first door, they entered what looked to be a normal bar. Although, if you were there for more than an hour, you would notice that no matter how much you tried to drink another bottle would appear on the shelf. And even better, the bar always had the exact drink you wanted available. An unlimited supply of every alcoholic beverage in existence. It was, in short, a drunkard's paradise.When they entered the second door, they were greeted by a myriad of women all ready to satisfy every sexual desire they could possible have. There were multiple women of every shape, size and ethnicity imaginable. Looking closer you would notice that there were even celebrity and work crushes from your life in the crowd. Every single one of them ready  to please you. It was, in short, a pervert's paradiseFinally, when they entered the third door, they found themselves in a forest made of cannabis. The ground was made of kief, all the bushes wore beatiful buds and even the trees were 20 feet tall cannabis plants. There were every strain it has or ever will be possible to grow. You could even find rocks of hashish laying around the forest floor if you looked closely. It was, in short, a stoner's paradise.The Devil asked the men which room they each wanted. The words had barely left the Devil's mouth before the first man ran directly to the room with a myriad of women. The second man then went to the room with the bar, thinking that if he was going to spend 666 years in hell, he might as well be drunk for most of it. Lastly, the third man, thinking he had won the lottery, gladly went towards the room with the forest of cannabis.666 years later, the Devil returned to see if the men had atoned for their sins.When he opened the first door, bottles slowly rolled out and you could immediately smell piss and puke coming from the room. It took the Devil a while, but he finally found the man nestled between the bottles, smeared in his own shit and puke, and with arguably the worst hangover in history. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.When he opened the second door, he was overwhelmed with the sound of hundreds of crying children and angry women. Not ten seconds after the door opened, the man came running, pleading for the Devil to please let him out. There were kids of every age running around screaming and all the women were angry at each other, while everyone, children and mothers alike, were angry at the man. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.When the Devil opened the third door, he immediately saw the man sitting cross legged in a giant pool of his own tears. The Devil had not expected this. Confused, he went to ask the man what was wrong.	The man, tears still running down his face, looked up at the Devil and said:I don't have a lighter
A guy walks into a restaurant with a full-grown ostrich behind him.  The waitress asks for their orders. The guy says, A hamburger, fries, and a coke, and turns to the ostrich, What's yours?I'll have the same, says the ostrich.A short time later the waitress returns with the order. That will be $18.40 please. The man reaches into his pocket and, without looking, pulls out the exact change for payment.The next day, the guy and the ostrich come again and the guy says, A hamburger, fries, and a coke.The ostrich says, I'll have the same.Again the guy reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. This becomes routine until one night they enter the restaurant and the waitress asks, The usual?No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato, and salad, says the guy.Me too, says the ostrich.The waitress brings the order and says, That will be $42.62.Once again the guy pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. The waitress can't hold back her curiosity any longer. Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?Well, says the guy, several years ago I was cleaning my attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it a genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.That's brilliant! says the waitress. Most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!That's right.	Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there, says the guy.The waitress asks, But, sir, what's with the ostrich?The guy sighs and answers, My second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who agrees with everything I say.

He orders three mugs and drinks them in turn.One day, he comes in and only orders two mugs. All the regulars take notice and fall silent.	When he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, I don't want to intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my condolences on your loss.The cowboy looks quite puzzled for a moment, then a light dawns in his eyes and he laughs.Oh, no, everybody's just fine, he explains.It's just that my wife and I joined the Baptist Church and I had to quit drinking.It hasn't affected my brothers though.

Walking through the forest, an atheist hears a rustling in the bushes. Turning, he sees a massive grizzly charging towards him! He runs as fast as he can but trips over a stump and falls. As the bear raises a huge paw to strike, the atheist screams: God! Help me!Time freezes. The bear becomes immobile, the forest is silent, and the river stops running. Then the atheist hears a powerful voice: You have denied my existence for years, taught others I don’t exist and credited my creation to a cosmic accident. Why should I help you? It would be hypocritical to ask you to show mercy on me, the atheist agrees. But perhaps you could make the bear a Christian?	At that, the noise of the forest resumes, the river runs, and the bear drops to its knees, brings its paws together, and says, Lord, for this food which I am about to receive, I am truly thankful.

A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night? The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.The man says, All right, all right. I’m dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 pebbles on the earth.The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door.The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, Real funny.	May I have the key?The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.The man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.

A young Law student, having failed his Law exam, goes up to his crusty old professor, who is renowned for his razor-sharp legal mind. Student, Sir, do you really understand everything about this subject? Professor, Actually, I probably do. Otherwise I wouldn't be a professor, would I? Student, OK. So I'd like to ask you a question. If you can give me the correct answer, I will accept my marks as it is. If you can't give me the correct answer, however, you'll have to give me an A. Professor, Hmmmm, alright. So what's the question? Student, What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? The professor wracks his famous brain, but just can't crack the answer. Finally he gives up and changes the student's failing mark into an A as agreed, and the student goes away, very pleased. The professor continues to wrack his brain over the question all afternoon, but still can't get the answer. So finally he calls in a group of his brightest students and tells them he has a really, really tough question to answer, What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? To the professor's surprise (and embarrassment), all the students immediately raise their hands. All right, says the professor and asks his favorite student to answer.It's quite easy, sir says the student You see, you are 75 years old and married to a 30 year old woman, which is legal, but not logical. Your wife has a 22 year old lover, which is logical, but not legal.	And your wife's lover failed his exam but you've just given him an A, which is neither legal, nor logical.

After a pause, the instructor added, I gave you an extra 50% because you did it all through the muffler, which I’ve never seen done in my entire career.

The farmer and his wife needed a new bull... There was a man who lived on a farm with his wife in the middle of nowhere. All they owned was a truck, a few cows, and an old bull. They didn't have much, but they were happy. One day, the farmer woke up and found that the bull had died. He went to his wife and said, I take our money into the town and buy us a new bull. I know you need the truck here to keep the farm running, so when I get us a bull, I'll send you a telegraph so you know when to pick us up.His wife went and got the money and then said goodbye.The farmer arrived in town late that day and had to get a hotel room. The next morning he only had 401 dollars left. He went to the market and was able to buy a strong, young bull with the 400 dollars. It had been a long time since he had been to town, but as long as the telegraph prices hadn't gone up, he should be able to send a full sentence to his wife with his dollar.When he arrived at the post office, he said to the telegraph operator: I need to send a message to my wife so she can pick up my bull and I. How much is a word?Prices went up a few years ago, replied the operator. A word is 1 dollar.Oh no, said the farmer I can only send one word! He thought for a little while and then said, Ok, send my wife the word 'comfortable.'Comfortable? Are you sure? asked the operator.My wife has a 4th grade education, the farmer replied. When she reads she has to sound each word out syllable by syllable.	So when she sees the word comfortable, she'll read it as 'come-for-ta-bull.'

Balls.. A big Texan stopped at a local restaurant following a day roaming around in Mexico. While sipping his tequila, he noticed a sizzling, scrumptious looking platter being served at the next table. Not only did it look good, but the smell was wonderful. He asked the waiter, What is that you just served? The waiter replied, Ah, Señor, you have excellent taste! Those are called Cojones de Toro, bull's testicles from the bull fight this morning. A real delicacy! The cowboy said, What the heck, bring me an order. The waiter replied, I am so sorry, Señor. There is only one serving per day because there is only one bull fight each morning. If you come early and place your order, we will be sure to save you this delicacy. The next morning, the cowboy returned, placed hisorder, and that evening was served the one and only special delicacy of the day. After a few bites, inspecting his platter, he called to the waiter and said, These are delicious, but they are much, much smaller than the ones I saw you serve yesterday. The waiter shrugged his shoulders and replied, Si, Señor.	Sometimes the bull wins.

And she noticed... What's wrong? Scarlett Johansson asked, Nothing... the guy would say...She pestered him for a while eventually saying she would do ANYTHING he needed or wanted to make him feel good again, just because she really cared for him a lot, and even if he wasn't asking, she felt it was the least she owed it to him...Really?, you'll do anything I'd like?yes she said anything!ok, first i want you to take off you toga and get into this pair of work jeans that somehow washed on the shoreok...now put this shirt on please, but first, tape your boobs so they are flatwha... ok, I'd say I'd do anything she said lovingly.ok, now, take this hat and wear it, but tuck your hair under itShe was kinda confused, but non the less, she wanted to make him happy, so she tucked her hair under the hat.Now id like for you to grab this piece of soot and paint yourself a beard and a mustacheok... if this is what you want... she muttered.now, please, put on these sunglasses, and start walking down the beach I'll catch up to you in a bit, he said a bit excited...She started walking... wondering... doubting herself... just confused about what had just happened, maybe it wasn't her, maybe it was h... suddenly the guy grabs her by her shoulder turns her around and says: DUDE!!!	you won't believe who I've been fucking for the past 6 months!

He goes back to the Canadians' room, along the way being begged by all sorts of people to put the heating back down. He enters the room to see the Canadians having a barbecue. Furiously, he asks them what they're doing.Well, we can't pass up this wonderful weather without getting out the barbecue!The devil realizes he's been doing the wrong thing. He goes to the boiler room and turns it down until it's at a colder temperature than ever seen on earth.

Your DUCK IS DEAD. A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest.After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.The distressed woman wailed, Are you sure?Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead, replied the vet..How can you be so sure? she protested.. I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.The vet looked at the woman and said, I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. $1,500! she cried,$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!The vet shrugged, I'm sorry.	If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500.

On the lowest branch of a tree, there is a caterpillar looking at a bud. Hungrily, it says: I'll be damned if don't eat this bud. But I'll wait until it has bloomed so that I can go and fill my belly !! and then it waits patiently for the bud to bloom. Higher on that tree, a sparrow is looking at the caterpillar and says: I'll be damned if don't eat this caterpillar. But I'll wait until it has eaten the bud so that I can go and fill my belly!! and then it waits patiently for the caterpillar to eat the bud. Watching from another branch, a hawk hungrily looks at the sparrow and says: I'll be damned if don't eat this sparrow. But I will wait until it has eaten the caterpillar so that I can go and fill my belly. and then it waits patiently for the sparrow to eat the caterpillar.At the base of the tree, a cat is watching all this unfold and hungrily says:  I'll be damned if I don't eat this hawk. But I will wait until the hawk has eaten the sparrow so that I can go and fill my belly. and then waits for the right moment to jump on the hawk.A few moment pass and the bud starts to bloom.	Seeing this, the caterpillar goes and rushes for the bud, devouring the flower that started to bloom.Not wanting to miss his chance, the sparrow dives and goes for the caterpillar, eating it whole.With piercing eyes, the hawk reacts fast and swoops down on the sparrow, killing it with a swift strike.Having been preparing for a deadly attack on the hawk, the cat leaps on the branch and attempts to maul its prey.The total weight of the animals making the branch more frail, it breaks and the cat falls into a puddle of water.Moral of the story: the longer the build-up, the wetter the pussy.

He can’t help.He may be 85, says the wife, but his eyesight is perfect.So the next day Arthur heads off to the golf course with his brother-in-law.

I have perfect eyesight.Where did it go?	Arthur asks.I don’t remember.
Three men, Joe, Bro, and Buddy, all lived in a small town. One day, Joe went hunting alone, and for the next few days no one heard from him. About a week afterwards, a body was found and brought into the coroner’s office. The coroner, after thoroughly examining the body, needed a positive identification in order to verify that the body was indeed Joe. So, he brought in Bro and Buddy, and told them to come in separately to identify the body. Bro came in first, and was asked to look for any details about the body that he recognized. After a few minutes of examining, Bro said, Mr. Coroner, I’ll need you to turn the body over for me to be sure.Confused, the coroner obliged. Bro continued to examine the body, bent down on one knee, reared his head sideways, then stood up and said, No sir, this can’t be Joe.The coroner was even more confused, but he accepted this statement and sent Bro out. Next, he invited Buddy in to repeat the task. Buddy, after examining the body in a similar fashion to Bro, also requested that the body be turned over.The coroner, after mumbling a bit about his confusion, flipped the body over. Buddy too bent down on one knee and examined the back area of the body, then, just as Bro had previously, said, No sir, Mr. Coroner, this isn’t Joe.The coroner was astonished, so he asked that Bro come back in so that the two of them were standing there at once. The coroner said, Gentlemen, this man’s dental records and features match perfectly with those of your friend Joe’s. How on earth are you both positive this isn’t him?Bro and Buddy looked at each other, then Bro answered, Sir, this can’t be Joe because Joe has two assholes.In shock, the coroner asked, How can he have two assholes? Have you ever seen them?Buddy replied, No sir, but it was common knowledge. Every time we were out with him, people would say, ‘Look, it’s Joe with those two assholes!’**Credit goes to my grandmother, who was the first to tell me this joke.	**

Man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.You're in the afterlife! he tells the man, But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.What are the odds? they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line. The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. Come, the beggar told him, I'll take you to the evening meal. So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line, and then he added, and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. What is it, he thought, that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here? That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.The beggar laughed jovially. I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in! Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. That's the line for the dragon meat, he said before turning to the next line, and that's the line for angeldust stew, then he paused, confused.What is it?	the man asked his old friend.The beggar replied, There appears to be no punchline.

So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it. But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond.

[Serious] Just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive. A few days ago I was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.Here's the joke I told:What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.Obviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown?No, replied the guy.	He choked on a sock.
Five friends were sitting around, debating which Pixar movie is the greatest. After a few hours of debate, no one was willing to concede, and it was decided that a vote must be held. Unfortunately, with so few friends present, it was clear that they would need to bring the vote to the greater public. The group decided that each friend would make a plea to the subreddit of their choice, and whoever received the most karma for it would win.Adam, already undecided himself, decided to go to /r/AskReddit. He laid out the agreement, and asked that everyone vote one their favorite movie, and the one with the most votes he would use for the his friends. Unfortunately, as the votes were split in that sub, his highest post amounted to a mere 38 points.Paul, a big proponent for the Toy Story franchise, posted to /r/nostalgia in the hopes that everyone who grew up with Toy Story would agree. Unfortunately, as there had been two sequels (with a third on the way) it wasn't exactly considered nostalgia and he got downvoted into oblivion.Bill, who loved Monsters Inc., made his case using some trickery. Going to /r/news, he found a seemingly unrelated post, and made a top-level comment describing, in great detail, why Monsters Inc. was the greatest film of all time. The fact that the post was so out of context made everyone flock to it, and drew enough attention to new him over a thousand fake internet points.Mike, who loved the Incredibles movies, decided to stay in his wheelhouse. Over the course of several hours, he created each of the family members from the Incredibles in Soulcaliber VI. Finally, he photoshopped the family together, and posted it to /r/gaming. Under normal circumstances this would have skyrocketed to the top, but the format was stale, and thus only received 20k karma. Still, Mike was confident in his victory.While the other four friends came up with plans on how to maximize their karma gains, Chris sat silently.

'The Irishman said, 'Well, we got undressed and rubbed together, but then I stopped. 'The priest said, 'Rubbing together is the same as putting it in. You're not to see that woman again.

He said you looked very cute and asked if we had any vasoline. I told him yeah in the restroom.	Give him what he wants, honey be strong i love you too.

A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried. Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards.He listened a while longer, and said, There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too.

It's just Beethoven decomposing.

A professional gambler wins big and dies of an aneurysm. When he gets to the afterlife, he finds himself at the back of a miles-long line to get into Heaven.Drawing on his experience, the gambler immediately thinks of a way to get ahead of everyone else. He taps the old man ahead of him on the shoulder...Want to make a bet while we wait? The Gambler asks. If I can guess your last words in three tries, you have to let me cut ahead of you.The old man, having nothing better to do, agrees. Immediately, the gambler begins reading him like the pro player he is. He notices the elderly Asian man's shirt is open, exposing a pair of defibrillator marks.Don't be silly, it's just indigestion. the gambler remarks. The old man looks a bit surprised, then steps aside, giving up his place in line.Next, the gambler taps on a redneck's shoulder. He makes the same bet, and the redneck also accepts.This one's easy! the gambler smirks, sizing up the bruised, bloody, grass stained redneck with the caved in skull. Hold my beer!Muttering profanities, the redneck begrudgingly steps aside and gives up his place in line.Riding the high of a hot streak, the gambler wastes no time tapping the next man ahead of him on the shoulder. He quickly makes the same bet, and is ecstatic when the agreement is made.Okay, let's see... The gambler studies the new mark carefully. He's a large, imposing black man riddled with several bullet holes.The gambler holds his hand out like a gun. You ain't taking me alive!The man shakes his head. Wrong. The gambler strokes his chin. The guy is giving him nothing else to work with.The gambler holds the 'gun' sideways, makes a mean face, and shouts, Fuck the police!Wrong again. The gambler's getting frustrated, now. He's never been unable to read someone before.Finally, the gambler throws his hands in the air. I'VE GOT NOTHING! He shouts.	I GIVE UP!The man steps aside.

Jesus and Moses are golfing in a threesome. Moses tees off first and uncorks a high sailing slice. The ball plops into the middle of a lake. Unperturbed, Moses walks to the edge of the lake, raises his club, and the waters part. Moses chips onto the green. Jesus tees off next. He blades a worm-burner that heads for the lake, skipping thrice and coming to rest on top of the water. Jesus walks out onto the water and chips onto the green. The third gentlemen hooks the everliving shit out of the ball. It goes into the road, gets hit by a car, ricochets across the fairway to the lake, is gobbled up by a frog, who is snatched by a stork. As the stork flies over the green, the frog spits out the ball, which rolls into the cup.	Moses turns to Jesus and says:  I hate playing with your Dad.

The policeman says, Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile.Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?The second guy smiles, flips his hair, and says, Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!The policeman angrily responds, What's the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?

Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that. He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?That's easy, the third guy replied.	He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear.

The sailor apologizes and they proceed with their game.The sailor now attempts to chip his ball out of the brush. He gets off a good shot, but it rolls back into a sand trap. Fuck, I missed! he says again.My son! Please, refrain from such sinful language! You will anger the Lord! the priest pleads. The sailor apologizes and they continue their game.The sailor takes a whack at his ball from the sandtrap. He has a great shot, landing the ball right on the green. Still it's not good enough for him, so yet again he mutters fuck, I missed!The priest bursts out, yelling my son! The Lord will strike you down should you continue in your sinful ways! You will be punished for your sins! The sailor apologizes profusely and lines up his putt. The putt heads straight for the hole... and then runs around the rim and stays out. FUCK! I MISSED! the sailor exclaims, louder than before.Out of nowhere, a lightning bolt shoots from the sky. It streaks down from the clouds and hits the priest, instantly killing him. A deep, booming voice from the heavens speaks... FUCK!	I MISSED!

Stormy Daniels and Queen Elizabeth went to the Pearly Gates on the same day.  They both met with an angel to find out if they would be admitted to Heaven.The angel said: Unfortunately, there's only one space available in Heaven today so I must decide which one of you will be admitted.The angel asked Stormy if there was some particular reason why she should go to Heaven. Stormy took off her top and said: Look at these, they're the most perfect breasts God ever created and I'm sure it will please God to be able to see them every day,for eternity.The angel thanked Stormy, and asked Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the same question.The Queen walked over to a toilet, pulled the lever and flushed it without saying a word.The Angel immediately said: Okay, your Majesty, you may go into Heaven.Stormy was outraged and asked, What was that all about? I showed you two of God's own perfect creations and you turned me down. She simply flushed a commode and she got admitted to Heaven!	Would you explain that to me?Sorry, Stormy, said the Angel, but even in Heaven, a royal flush beats a pair, no matter how big they are.
A sadist, a masochist, a murderer, a necrophile, a zoophile and a pyromaniac are all sitting on a bench in a mental institution, bored out of their minds. How about having sex with a cat? asked the zoophile. Let's have sex with the cat and then torture it, says the sadist. Let's have sex with the cat, torture it and then kill it, shouted the murderer. Let's have sex with the cat, torture it, kill it and then have sex with it again, said the necrophile. Let's have sex with the cat, torture it, kill it, have sex with it again and then burn it, said the pyromaniac.	Silence took over... and the masochist says: Meow.

Three people die and appear before Buddha. Stunned by the divine presence before them, they lower their heads.-Raise your heads. You were humble in life and your deeds were praiseworthy. You have earned the right to a reincarnation of your choice. You have much to accomplish yet though.One of the people takes a step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled.-Benevolent Buddha, what more could I possibly do in my next life? I thought I lived and acted to the fullest. Because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve.-My work was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. Right now, the world I leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.-My connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.-I know all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that I ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation.The three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.-Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?-Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.-You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?-Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.-This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?-W-well, I don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.	(edit: obligatory editted thanks to the kind people who handed over silver & gold to my stupid joke

The year is 1804 and a young man enlists on a ship.. ..his first voyage is to last 3 years, and even though the work is hard the young man takes to it like a fish in water.After only a few days he is running the riggin like an old hand, he swabs the decks without complaint and spends his free time in amicable companionship playing cards or telling tall tales.All in all the young man feels as if he has found his calling.A few weeks go by like this, the young man loving his new life except one part.. There are no women.After a couple of months like this, he is starting to feel extremely uncomfortable with the situation and voices his complaints to his shipmates one evening.Why don't you just use the barrel? Asks one of his mates with a surprised look .It turns out that down in the hold, in a dark corner there is a barrel, with a hole drilled into the side.. Whenever the sailors start to feel their urges rise, they simply go down to the barrel and take care of their business there.The young man decides, with some scepticism, to try the barrel, and finds to his surprise that it is a wholly pleasant experience, in no way lesser than any he has had with real women before.With this new found release the young man starts to enjoy his work even more. His days continue as before, and his evenings are still spent in pleasant company, but a new addition to his routine is a nightly visit to the barrel.Another two months pass in this way and all is well, until one night as he gets up from his seat at the card table and announces that he is going to visit the barrel to his mates.A few chuckles greet this announcement and one of his friends asks Trying to get the final fun out of it eh?Final fun? Are we getting rid of the barrel?	The young man asks, worry playing over his face.Not at all mate, it's just that.. next month is your turn in the barrel.
Unbutton my blouse.. A successful rancher died and left everything to his devoted wife. She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand... Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk. She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.. For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well. Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels. The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night. One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return. Two o'clock and no hired hand. Finally he returned around two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him. She quietly called him over to her.. Unbutton my blouse and take it off, she said. Trembling, he did as she directed. Now take off my boots. He did as she asked, ever so slowly.. Now take off my socks. He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots. Now take off my skirt. He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light. Now take off my bra.. Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.	Then she looked at him and said, If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired.
A man answered an ad that read Hiring welders $18-$24 per hour. When he arrived he was told he'd have to take a welding test. He turned in 2 sets of welds. One was a great weld, the other was a mess. When the boss asked him why he did this he replied One is $18/hr, the other is $24/hr.

Three women die and go to heaven. When they get there, St. Peter says: We only have one rule here in heaven: don’t step on the ducks! So they enter heaven, and there are ducks all over the place. It is almost impossible not to step on a duck, and although they try their best to avoid them, the first woman accidentally steps on one.Along comes St. Peter with the ugliest man she ever saw. St. Peter chains them together and says: Your punishment for stepping on a duck is to spend eternity chained to this man!The next day, the second woman accidentally steps on a duck and along comes St. Peter. With him is another extremely ugly man. He chains them together with the same admonishment as for the first woman.The third woman has observed all this and is very careful where she steps.She manages to go months without stepping on any ducks, but one day St. Peter comes up to her with the most handsome man she has ever laid eyes on.	St. Peter chains them together without saying a word.The happy woman says: I wonder what I did to deserve being chained to you for all of eternity?The guy says: I don’t know about you, but I stepped on a duck!
Scotsman, Englishman, and an Irishman walk into a bar. Sitting in a bar the Scotsman says, As good as this bar is, I still prefer the pubs back home. In Glasgow, there's a wee place. The landlord goes out of his way for the locals. When you buy four drinks, he'll buy the fifth drink. Well, said the Englishman, At my local in London , the barman will buy you your third drink after you buy the first two. Ahhh, dat's nothin', said the Irishman, back home in my favorite pub, the moment you set foot in the place, they'll buy you a drink, then another, all the drinksyou like, actually. Then, when you've had enough drinks, they'll take you upstairs and see that you gets laid, all on the house! The Englishman and Scotsman were suspicious of the claims. The Irishman swore every word was true.	Then the Englishman asked, Did this actually happen to you?Not to me, personally, no, admitted the Irishman, but it did happen to me sister quite a few times.

Three bulls heard the rancher was bringing another bull onto the ranch. First Bull: I've been here five years. I'm not giving this new bull any of my 100 cows.Second Bull: I've been here three years and have earned my right to 50 cows. I'm keeping all my cows.Third Bull: I've only been here a year, and so far, you guys have only let me have 10 cows. I may not be as big as you fellows, but I'm keeping all 10 of my cows.Just then an 18-wheeler pulls up in the pasture carrying the biggest bull they've ever seen. At 4,700 pounds, each step he takes strains the steel ramp.First Bull: I think I can spare a few cows for our new friend.Second Bull: I actually have too many cows to take care of. I can spare a few. I'm certainly not looking for an argument.They look over at the third bull and find him pawing the dirt, shaking his horns and snorting.First Bull: Son, don't be foolish -- let him have some of your cows and live to tell about it.Third Bull: Hell, he can have all my cows.	I'm just making sure he knows I'm a bull.

That's how mafia works. A Mafia Godfather finds out that his bookkeeper, Enzo, has cheated him out of 10 million bucks. His bookkeeper is deaf and mute, that was the reason he got the job in the first place. It was assumed that Enzo would hear nothing that he might have to testify about in court. When the Godfather goes to confront Enzo about his missing $10 million, he takes along his lawyer who knows sign language. The Godfather tells the lawyer, Ask him where the 10 million bucks is that he embezzled from me.The lawyer, using sign language, asks Enzo where the money is.Enzo signs back, I don't know what you are talking about.The lawyer tells the Godfather, He says he doesn't know what you are talking about.The Godfather pulls out a pistol, puts it to Enzo's temple and says, Ask him again!The lawyer signs to Enzo, He'll kill you if you don't tell him.Enzo signs back, OK. You win!	The money is in a brown briefcase, buried behind the shed in my cousin Bruno's backyard in Woodbridge !The Godfather asks the lawyer, What did he say?The lawyer replies,  He says you don't have the balls to pull the trigger.

[Serious] Just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive. A few days ago I was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.Here's the joke I told:What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.Obviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown?No, replied the guy.	He choked on a sock.

Father, do you have anything to declare? A beautiful young woman, on an international flight, asked the priest beside her, Father, may I ask a favor?Of course you may.

As a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: 5 lamb chops, please.  Amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop. He follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and trot across the road to a bus-stop. The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench. When a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus. The butcher follows, dumbstruck. As the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery. After awhile he stands on his back paws to push the stop bell, then the butcher follows him off. The dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step. He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door. He does this again and again. No answer. So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window, jumps off, and waits at the front door. A big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog. The butcher runs up and screams at the guy: What the hell are you doing? This dog's a genius! The owner responds, Genius, my ass.........	It's the second time this week he's forgotten his keys!

There was this tramp. One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.Coincidentally the father drives up. How can I ever thank you sir? he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.Ah, well... stammers the tramp, ... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.Oh dear, says the father, I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.No! No! says the tramp, Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.Ten pounds, thinks the tramp, I'm rich! I'm rich! and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. I'll have one holiday please!Ahem, which holiday would sir like? asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds, replies the tramp.TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds, says the girl incredulously.She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.Well you'll never believe it, she says to the tramp, back in the shop. I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.Yippee! exclaims the tramp, I'll take it!A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.Get off my ship ye dirty bum! shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.But I've got my ticket!, responds the tramp, super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!Well okay, says the captain, but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.Psst, says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6 pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3 deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.Sheer luxury! exclaimed the tramp, A room of my very own.I'm glad you like it, replies the captain, but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what a dive...!Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.That was amazing! exclaimed the captain, Where did you learn to dive like that?Um, well I've never actually dived before, replied the tramp.Well that's incredible! says the captain, I've never seen... He broke off. Hey, I've got an idea, he started again. How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!It's a deal! says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.Then one morning the captain comes to talk. Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.Okay, agreed the tramp.Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.Well, tramp, said the captain, shaking his hand, Let's see what you can do. And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...up and up...below him the ship grew smaller...on and on...past a solitary albatross...and still higher...till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...and on still further.../ till the ocean grew dim...and the earth itself...began to shrink...past our moon...and on...and Mars...and on...higher, and higher...through the asteroid belt...and on and on towards the diving board...past the outer planets, until...on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...he reached the board.He climbed on top and radioed the captain...and then....' '.. .. .he jumped.....:Slowly at first,:but speeding up,:::faster, and faster,:speeding past Pluto,:and the other outer planets,.........through the asteroid belt,past Mars,and the moon,faster,and faster,faster - ever faster,and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,faster, and faster,past the albatross,double-back somersault,and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,I CAN SEE HIM! yelled a passenger, LOOK!! !The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!DOWN!DOWN!THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!STILL DOWN...!DEEPER,DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,TILL.........SMASH!Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.Up and up, desperate, gasping...Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.HERO! WONDERFUL! AMAZING! GOOD SHOW THAT!And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.The tramp blushed.The captain went on, but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: Well you see...For me to tell you, I'll need $49.95The captain outrageously asked why.The tramp said The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes, As for cost, we selected initial values based upon data from the Open Beta and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch.

An ancient mathematical joke. Once upon a time, there were three kingdoms, all bordering on the same lake. For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner.The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage.	The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.
A Mom visits her son for dinner who lives with a girl roommate.

You don't suppose she took it, do you?He said ,Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just to be sure.He sat down and wrote :Dear Mother:I'm not saying that you ‘did' take the silver plate from my house, I'm not saying that you ‘did not' take the silver plate .. But the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.Love,your sonSeveral days later, he received an email from his Mother which read:Dear Son:I'm not saying that you ‘do' sleep with your roommate, and I'm not saying that you ‘do not' sleep with her.	But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her OWN bed, she would have found the silver plate by now, under the pillow…Love,Mom.﻿

A gambler dies and goes to Heaven... A professional gambler wins big and dies of an aneurysm.

If I can guess your last words in three tries, you have to let me cut ahead of you.The old man, having nothing better to do, agrees. Immediately, the gambler begins reading him like the pro player he is. He notices the elderly Asian man's shirt is open, exposing a pair of defibrillator marks.Don't be silly, it's just indigestion. the gambler remarks. The old man looks a bit surprised, then steps aside, giving up his place in line.Next, the gambler taps on a redneck's shoulder. He makes the same bet, and the redneck also accepts.This one's easy! the gambler smirks, sizing up the bruised, bloody, grass stained redneck with the caved in skull. Hold my beer!Muttering profanities, the redneck begrudgingly steps aside and gives up his place in line.Riding the high of a hot streak, the gambler wastes no time tapping the next man ahead of him on the shoulder. He quickly makes the same bet, and is ecstatic when the agreement is made.Okay, let's see... The gambler studies the new mark carefully. He's a large, imposing black man riddled with several bullet holes.The gambler holds his hand out like a gun. You ain't taking me alive!The man shakes his head. Wrong. The gambler strokes his chin. The guy is giving him nothing else to work with.The gambler holds the 'gun' sideways, makes a mean face, and shouts, Fuck the police!Wrong again. The gambler's getting frustrated, now. He's never been unable to read someone before.Finally, the gambler throws his hands in the air. I'VE GOT NOTHING! He shouts.	I GIVE UP!The man steps aside.

Thanks! and runs out of the bar.A couple hours goes by and the bartender is starting to get nervous. Suddenly the man walks back into the bar with a big smile on his face.Did you kill the guy? The bartender asks nervously.Nope! I slept with your wife.	Whiskey please.

A priest told me this joke as a kid. There were 3 men, they were best friends, and they were quite unhealthy. Their names were, Bert, Chester, and Earl.They were actually really unhealthy and Bert decided that he needed to take charge of him and his friends' health. He decided that they were going to be on a diet together to help them live for as long as possible. He broke the news to his friends, and they weren't too happy about it, but they decided to go along with it anyways, because they knew how out-of-shape they all were. It was tough for them all to stick to the plan at times, however they got through it together. They each lost between 120-140 pounds over the course of 20 years and were in amazing shape for their age.One day the 3 of them were given great news.Bert got a call, he answered it, then turned around to everyone and said: Guys! My daughter just had a child! I'm going to be a grandpa!. Everybody was celebrating for Bert when Earl got a call from his son. He answered it, and turned around to everybody and said:Guys! My son is going to get married today! I'm so excited!. Everybody was now celebrating for Bert and Earl, when Chester got a call. He answered it, turned around and said to everybody: Guys! My family is having a reunion today! I'm going to see so many people that I haven't seen in years!.They found out that the wedding, hospital, and park where the reunion was were all in the same town, and decided to carpool together to get there. It had snowed a little the day before and the roads were a little icy. As they were getting onto the highway, their car slipped and ran into a semi-truck. It killed all three of them.The three of them wake up together in heaven. They notice an angel standing over them and one of them asks Where are we?. The angels says: Congratulations, you made it to heaven. The angel decides to show them around the place and starts at a banquet. Here is a banquet for you three to enjoy, you've earned it. Chester looks a little sad, and Earl notices and asks him, What's wrong?. Chester finally speaks up, Okay, this is so nice of you to put together, but we're on a diet. I wouldn't want to overdo my calorie intake for the day. The angle replies to them, No worries, you can have as much food as you like without worrying about it. The guys are elated by that news, when the angel decides to show them another place.Next, the angel decides to show them a place where they can spend time having fun. He shows them to a massive building with games everywhere you look. There are at least 50 pool tables, 30 bowling alley lanes, people are playing poker, there are arcade games everywhere, and tons of people enjoying themselves. He tells them,This is where you may spend much of your time, if you choose. Many people enjoy it here and you might find some new friends. The guys really like this room, but Earl notices that Chester is looking sad again. Earls asks him,What's wrong?. Chester responds with,My wife left me because of my gambling problems, I don't want to disappoint anyone else because of it. I'm afraid I wont be able to enjoy this area. The angel then slightly irritated lets him know,Don't you see? There are no problems here. You don't have to worry about gambling issues, because money isn't an issue here. Chester is especially happy to hear that news, and the angel decides to show them where they are going to live.The angel finally takes them to the third place, and it is a huge mansion. The guys are led inside, when the angel says, This is where you three can live, if you choose to. Otherwise we have some other mansions, if you want to live alone. The guys are very intrigued by the house, they notice a big window on a wall with an amazing view. They could see for at least 5 miles clearly. They all can't help but gasp when looking through the window. Earl can't help but be concerned about this place. He decides to ask, So, uh... What's the rent here?. The angel looks back at them with an irritated glare are replies Nothing? It's free. Earl is sure to thank the angel and says,Wow! That's so kind of you guys!. Bert notices that Chester is looking a little sad. Bert says,What's wrong Chester? Isn't it amazing here?. Chester looks up, looks Bert in the eye and says a little mad, If it weren't for your goddamn diet. Bert.	We could've been here 20 years ago!.

Once upon a time there lived a ravishing Queen with huge tits.. Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear.	The King immediately summoned Nick.

The moving walkway motor jammed, so he un-jams it. People can get from place to place more easily. The TV was grainy and unclear, so he fixes the connection to the Satellite dish and now they get hundreds of high def channels. One day, God decides to look down on Hell to see how his grand design is working out and notices that everyone is happy and enjoying umbrella drinks. He asks the Devil what's up? The Devil says, Things are great down here since you sent us an engineer. What? says God. An engineer? I didn't send you one of those. That must have been a mistake. Send him upstairs immediately. The Devil responds, No way. We want to keep our engineer. We like him. God demands, If you don't send him to me immediately, I'll sue! The Devil laughs.	Where are YOU going to get a lawyer?

Five friends were sitting around, debating which Pixar movie is the greatest. After a few hours of debate, no one was willing to concede, and it was decided that a vote must be held. Unfortunately, with so few friends present, it was clear that they would need to bring the vote to the greater public. The group decided that each friend would make a plea to the subreddit of their choice, and whoever received the most karma for it would win.Adam, already undecided himself, decided to go to /r/AskReddit. He laid out the agreement, and asked that everyone vote one their favorite movie, and the one with the most votes he would use for the his friends. Unfortunately, as the votes were split in that sub, his highest post amounted to a mere 38 points.Paul, a big proponent for the Toy Story franchise, posted to /r/nostalgia in the hopes that everyone who grew up with Toy Story would agree. Unfortunately, as there had been two sequels (with a third on the way) it wasn't exactly considered nostalgia and he got downvoted into oblivion.Bill, who loved Monsters Inc., made his case using some trickery. Going to /r/news, he found a seemingly unrelated post, and made a top-level comment describing, in great detail, why Monsters Inc. was the greatest film of all time. The fact that the post was so out of context made everyone flock to it, and drew enough attention to new him over a thousand fake internet points.Mike, who loved the Incredibles movies, decided to stay in his wheelhouse. Over the course of several hours, he created each of the family members from the Incredibles in Soulcaliber VI. Finally, he photoshopped the family together, and posted it to /r/gaming. Under normal circumstances this would have skyrocketed to the top, but the format was stale, and thus only received 20k karma. Still, Mike was confident in his victory.While the other four friends came up with plans on how to maximize their karma gains, Chris sat silently. For hours he sat, making no posts, coming up with no original content. Finally, an hour before the deadline, he broke into his neighbor's house, stealing his copy of the Pixar movie Up. He took a picture of his theft and posted it directly to /r/Jokes with the title STOLEN.When the group got together the next day to see who got the most votes, everyone was in awe. Chris's post had over 40,000 points. How did you know that would win? Easy, Chris replied.	Everyone knows stolen content on /r/Jokes gets all the Up votes.

My grandfather died and I inherited some of his clothes. He was a farmer and he loved getting dressed up every year for the local fair and exhibiting his prize chickens. For this occasion, my grandmother would spend the entire year searching through thrift shops looking for silly neckties for him to wear, and she loved finding ones with chickens on them.After a few decades of this, my grandfather had amassed several dozen neckties, each one with cartoonish images of chickens flying around, laying eggs, and doing other chicken things. I always complimented him on the newest addition to his collection.When he died a couple of years ago, he bequeathed them to me in his will. When my grandmother handed me the bag full of them, my eyes welled with tears and I smiled thinking about my grandfather looking in the mirror and straightening his tie.Why am I telling you all of this back story?

Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community... If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each otherThe Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.The Rabbi pulled out an apple.With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue! 'Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.	'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'

A woman joins a country club and when she hears the guys talking about their golf round, she says, I played on my college's golf team. I was pretty good. Mind if I join you next week? No one wants to say 'yes', but they're on the spot.  Finally, one man says, Okay, but we start at 6:30 a.m.He figures the early tee-time will discourage her.The woman says this may be a problem and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late.They roll their eyes, but say, Okay.She's there at 6:30 am. sharp and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round.She's fun and pleasant and the guys are impressed.They congratulate her and invite her back the next week.She smiles, and says, I'll be there at 6:30, or 6:45.The next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp.Only this time, she plays left-handed.The three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand.They're totally amazed.They can't figure her out.She's very pleasant and a gracious winner.They invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.The third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys.This week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them.The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part.However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.This woman is a riddle no one can figure out.They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse and finally, one of the men asks her, How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?The lady blushes, and grins.

Just got back from a job interview, where I was asked if can perform under pressure. 	I said I wasn't too sure about that but I do a wicked Bohemian Rhapsody.
Joe was moderately successful in his career, but as he got older he was increasingly hampered by incredible headaches. When his personal hygiene and love life started to suffer, he sought medical help. After being referred from one specialist to another, he finally came across a doctor who solved the problem. The good news is I can cure your headaches; the bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press up against the base of your spine. The pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles. Joe was shocked and depressed, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife. After the operation, his mind was clear, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. He walked past a men's clothing store and thought, That's what I need, a new suit. He entered the shop and told the salesman, I'd like a new suit. The salesman eyed him briefly and said, Let's see, size 44 long? Joe laughed, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. replied the salesman. Joe tried on the suit, and it fit him perfectly. As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, How about a new shirt? Joe thought for a moment and then said, Sure!. The salesman eyed Joe, then said, Let's see, 34 sleeve and 16 and a half neck.. Joe was surprised, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. came the familiar reply. Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly, as well. The salesman asked, How about new shoes?. Joe was on a roll and agreed. The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, Let's see, nine-and-a-half? Joe was astonished, That's right, how did you know?. It's my job. said the salesman, again. Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly, again. He walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, How about some new underwear? Joe thought for a second and said, Sure, why not. The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, Let's see, size 36. Joe laughed smugly, No, I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old. The shocked salesman shook his head, You can't possibly wear a size 34!	It would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache.

He applies for many jobs, ranging from a mechanic to delivering newspapers. However, he is not accepted for any of them. Slowly, he gives up on his dream of buying a car.Weeks later, Sandy tells his mother that he has got a job as a fence fixer. She is overjoyed for him, but something doesn't seem right. She has noticed her son occasionally sneaking out at nights. One night, she follows him, all the way to the rich neighbourhood on the other side of town. She watches as he rips out a fence from the front lawn of a house, and lays it down next to its foundations. Just before he leaves, she confronts him.Why have you been destroying other people's fences? she asks.They will pay me the next day to fix it, Sandy answers, ashamed.

I was out shopping tonight, when I saw a new brand of condoms called, Olympic.

You see, there are three colors, Gold, Silver and Bronze!What color are you going to wear tonight? she asked cheekily.Gold of course! I said proudly.She retorted, Really?!	Why don't you wear Silver, it would be nice if you came second for a change!

They look fine.The man slowly pulls off his oxygen mask, smiles at her, and says very slowly, Thank you very much.	That was wonderful.Now listen very, very closely: Are - my - test - results - back?

There was this tramp. One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.Coincidentally the father drives up. How can I ever thank you sir? he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.Ah, well... stammers the tramp, ... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.Oh dear, says the father, I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.No! No! says the tramp, Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.Ten pounds, thinks the tramp, I'm rich! I'm rich! and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. I'll have one holiday please!Ahem, which holiday would sir like? asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds, replies the tramp.TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds, says the girl incredulously.She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.Well you'll never believe it, she says to the tramp, back in the shop. I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.Yippee! exclaims the tramp, I'll take it!A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.Get off my ship ye dirty bum! shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.But I've got my ticket!, responds the tramp, super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!Well okay, says the captain, but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.Psst, says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6 pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3 deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.Sheer luxury! exclaimed the tramp, A room of my very own.I'm glad you like it, replies the captain, but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what a dive...!Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.That was amazing! exclaimed the captain, Where did you learn to dive like that?Um, well I've never actually dived before, replied the tramp.Well that's incredible! says the captain, I've never seen... He broke off. Hey, I've got an idea, he started again. How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!It's a deal! says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.Then one morning the captain comes to talk. Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.Okay, agreed the tramp.Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.Well, tramp, said the captain, shaking his hand, Let's see what you can do. And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...up and up...below him the ship grew smaller...on and on...past a solitary albatross...and still higher...till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...and on still further.../ till the ocean grew dim...and the earth itself...began to shrink...past our moon...and on...and Mars...and on...higher, and higher...through the asteroid belt...and on and on towards the diving board...past the outer planets, until...on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...he reached the board.He climbed on top and radioed the captain...and then....' '.. .. .he jumped.....:Slowly at first,:but speeding up,:::faster, and faster,:speeding past Pluto,:and the other outer planets,.........through the asteroid belt,past Mars,and the moon,faster,and faster,faster - ever faster,and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,faster, and faster,past the albatross,double-back somersault,and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,I CAN SEE HIM! yelled a passenger, LOOK!! !The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!DOWN!DOWN!THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!STILL DOWN...!DEEPER,DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,TILL.........SMASH!Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.Up and up, desperate, gasping...Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.HERO! WONDERFUL! AMAZING! GOOD SHOW THAT!And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.The tramp blushed.The captain went on, but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: Well you see...For me to tell you, I'll need $49.95The captain outrageously asked why.The tramp said The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes, As for cost, we selected initial values based upon data from the Open Beta and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch.	Among other things, we’re looking at average per-player credit earn rates on a daily basis, and we’ll be making constant adjustments to ensure that players have challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via gameplay.We appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on Reddit, our forums and across numerous social media outlets.Our team will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update everyone as soon and as often as we can.
There's a little-known legend about Attila the Hun... The story goes that Attila used to collect exotic animals that he found during his conquests. He particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was a giant snake. He was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign.But his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet.Wishing to save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent.	Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.Curious, Attila did as he asked.Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.Now hold these in both hands, he instructed.Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.To an amazed Attila, the old man simply said,Thy anaconda don't want nun unless you've got buns, Hun.

A CNN reporter, a BBC reporter, and an Israeli commando are captured by ISIS in Syria. The leader of the terrorists told them that he would grant them each one last request before they were beheaded.The CNN Reporter said, Well, I’m an American, so I’d like one last hamburger with French fries.The leader nodded to an underling who left and returned with the burger & fries. The reporter ate it and said Now, I can die.The BBC Reporter said, I’m a reporter to the end. I want to take out my tape recorder and describe the scene here and what’s about to happen. Maybe someday someone will hear it and know that I was on the job till the end.The ISIS leader directed an aide to hand over the tape recorder and dictated some comments. The reporter then said, Now I can die knowing I stayed true until the end.The ISIS leader turned to the Israeli commando and said, And now, Mr. Israeli tough guy, what is your final wish?Kick me in the butt , said the soldier.What? asked the leader, Will you mock us in your last hour?No, I’m not kidding. I want you to kick me in the butt , insisted the Israeli.So the terrorist leader shoved him into the open and kicked him in the behind. The soldier went sprawling, but rolled to his knees, pulled a 9 mm pistol from under his flak jacket, and shot the leader dead. In the resulting confusion, he jumped to his knapsack, pulled out his carbine and sprayed the terrorists with gunfire. In a flash, all terrorists were either dead or fleeing for their lives. As the soldier was untying the reporters, they asked him, Why didn’t you just shoot them in the beginning? Why did you ask them to kick you in the butt first?What?	replied the Israeli, and have you report that I was the aggressor?
Balls.. A big Texan stopped at a local restaurant following a day roaming around in Mexico. While sipping his tequila, he noticed a sizzling, scrumptious looking platter being served at the next table. Not only did it look good, but the smell was wonderful. He asked the waiter, What is that you just served? The waiter replied, Ah, Señor, you have excellent taste! Those are called Cojones de Toro, bull's testicles from the bull fight this morning. A real delicacy! The cowboy said, What the heck, bring me an order. The waiter replied, I am so sorry, Señor. There is only one serving per day because there is only one bull fight each morning. If you come early and place your order, we will be sure to save you this delicacy. The next morning, the cowboy returned, placed hisorder, and that evening was served the one and only special delicacy of the day. After a few bites, inspecting his platter, he called to the waiter and said, These are delicious, but they are much, much smaller than the ones I saw you serve yesterday. The waiter shrugged his shoulders and replied, Si, Señor.	Sometimes the bull wins.

I proposed my Russian girlfriend and she said Yes! For the wedding, my whole family and friends flew over to her home town of Moscow.It was a beautiful ceremony, however I did find some things strange. For instance, the priest never said, You may now kiss the bride, but I just assumed it was purely an American thing and didn't mind.Later during the reception, we were both starving and decided to head over to the buffet to get food. On the way we passed the drink table, where about six people were waiting to get a fruity drink from a bowl.As we passed, they all said in unison, You may now kiss the bride!	My wife got giddy and gave me a big kiss, which I of course returned.As we walked away I asked, Why did *they* tell us to kiss and not the priest?My wife answered,In Soviet Russia, the punchline tells you!

As a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: 5 lamb chops, please.

No answer.So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window,jumps off, and waits at the front door.A big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog.The butcher runs up and screams at the guy: What the hell are you doing?This dog's a genius!The owner responds, Genius, my ass.........It's the second time this week he's forgotten his keys!
Dave was bragging to his boss one day.  You know, I know everyone there is to know.

Come on in for a beer!Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.No, no, just name anyone else, Dave says.President Trump, his boss quickly retorts.Yup, Dave says, Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington, and off they go.At the White House, Trump spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.

Stoner Joke. Three Men Died and Went to Hell Where They Met the Devil. (Warning! Long one) Three men died and went to hell where they met the Devil. The Devil told them that they had sinned in life and therefore had to spend the next 666 years in hell to atone for their sins. However, since the Devil wasn't entirely merciless, he would let them choose for themselves how they were going to spend those 666 years. And so the Devil let the men to three doors.Going through the first door, they entered what looked to be a normal bar. Although, if you were there for more than an hour, you would notice that no matter how much you tried to drink another bottle would appear on the shelf. And even better, the bar always had the exact drink you wanted available. An unlimited supply of every alcoholic beverage in existence. It was, in short, a drunkard's paradise.When they entered the second door, they were greeted by a myriad of women all ready to satisfy every sexual desire they could possible have. There were multiple women of every shape, size and ethnicity imaginable. Looking closer you would notice that there were even celebrity and work crushes from your life in the crowd. Every single one of them ready  to please you. It was, in short, a pervert's paradiseFinally, when they entered the third door, they found themselves in a forest made of cannabis. The ground was made of kief, all the bushes wore beatiful buds and even the trees were 20 feet tall cannabis plants. There were every strain it has or ever will be possible to grow. You could even find rocks of hashish laying around the forest floor if you looked closely. It was, in short, a stoner's paradise.The Devil asked the men which room they each wanted. The words had barely left the Devil's mouth before the first man ran directly to the room with a myriad of women. The second man then went to the room with the bar, thinking that if he was going to spend 666 years in hell, he might as well be drunk for most of it. Lastly, the third man, thinking he had won the lottery, gladly went towards the room with the forest of cannabis.666 years later, the Devil returned to see if the men had atoned for their sins.When he opened the first door, bottles slowly rolled out and you could immediately smell piss and puke coming from the room. It took the Devil a while, but he finally found the man nestled between the bottles, smeared in his own shit and puke, and with arguably the worst hangover in history. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.When he opened the second door, he was overwhelmed with the sound of hundreds of crying children and angry women. Not ten seconds after the door opened, the man came running, pleading for the Devil to please let him out. There were kids of every age running around screaming and all the women were angry at each other, while everyone, children and mothers alike, were angry at the man. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.When the Devil opened the third door, he immediately saw the man sitting cross legged in a giant pool of his own tears. The Devil had not expected this. Confused, he went to ask the man what was wrong.	The man, tears still running down his face, looked up at the Devil and said:I don't have a lighter

Bangidy, bang, bang, bang. The next week, they start bayonet training. Again Sam is at the end of the line and again they run out just before they get to him. The Sergeant tells him to just pretend he has a bayonet at the end of his pretend rifle. So Sam goes running through the mock battle with his stick yelling, Bangidy, bang, bang, bang. Stabidy, stab, stab,stab. Well the unit finished basic training and gets called up to go into real battle. Our hapless hero finds himself eventually on a landing craft, hitting the beach. Unfortunately, they have never given him a real rifle and he still has his stick. He is wondering what in the heck he is going to do. As the unit fights his way inland, Sam mindlessly points his stick at an enemy soldier standing on a hill and yells, Bangidy, bang, bang, bang. To his amazement, the enemy soldier falls over dead! So he  aims his stick at another and yells, Bangidy, bang, bang, bang. And that enemy falls over dead! Now our hero is running madly along, pointing his stick at any enemy soldier he sees, yelling Bangidy, bang, bang, bang. Enemy soldiers are dropping like flies! An enemy jumps out from a bush beside him. Sam points his stick and yells, Stabidy, stab, stab, stab. The  other guy drops and writhes in pain. All of a sudden an enemy soldier comes walking slowly along a path. Sam carefully aims his stick at the soldier and yells, Bangidy,  bang, bang, bang. But the enemy soldier just keeps coming. Sam tries again, Bangidy, bang, bang, bang! Nothing. As the enemy soldier gets closer, Sam cries out, Stabidy, stab, stab, stab. But the enemy soldier runs right over him, crushing him.	As Sam lies dying, he hears the enemy soldier muttering, Tankidy, tank, tank, tank.

A guy is driving around the back woods of Montana and he sees a sign in front of a broken down shanty-style house:'Talking Dog For Sale.'    He rings the bell and the owner appears and tells him the dog is in the backyard. The guy goes into the backyard and sees a nice looking Labrador Retriever sitting there. You talk? he asks. Yep the Lab replies. After the guy recovers from the shock of hearing a dog talk, he says, So, what's your story? The Lab looks up and says, Well, I discovered that I could talk when I was pretty young. I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA. In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping, I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running... but the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of medals. I got married, had a mess of puppies, and now I'm just retired. The guy is amazed. He goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog. Ten dollars the owner says. The guy says Ten dollars? This dog is amazing! Why on Earth are you selling him so cheap? The owner said Because he's a liar.	He didn't do any of that shit!﻿

A guy walks into a restaurant with a full-grown ostrich behind him.  The waitress asks for their orders. The guy says, A hamburger, fries, and a coke, and turns to the ostrich, What's yours?I'll have the same, says the ostrich.A short time later the waitress returns with the order. That will be $18.40 please. The man reaches into his pocket and, without looking, pulls out the exact change for payment.The next day, the guy and the ostrich come again and the guy says, A hamburger, fries, and a coke.The ostrich says, I'll have the same.Again the guy reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. This becomes routine until one night they enter the restaurant and the waitress asks, The usual?No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato, and salad, says the guy.Me too, says the ostrich.The waitress brings the order and says, That will be $42.62.Once again the guy pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. The waitress can't hold back her curiosity any longer. Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?Well, says the guy, several years ago I was cleaning my attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it a genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.That's brilliant! says the waitress. Most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!That's right.	Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there, says the guy.The waitress asks, But, sir, what's with the ostrich?The guy sighs and answers, My second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who agrees with everything I say.

A Marine returns from duty in Iraq and is immediately reassigned to a remote location in Afghanistan. That evening he arrives at his new post; a run down mosque in the middle of nowhere.As he switches over with the marine currently stationed there, he realises there is no bed, no clean water, no toilet, just him, his weapon and the dirt on the floor. The next morning he wakes up to find a queue of naked men leading into the mosque. At the front, the mosque leader is in prayer with the man leading the line. As the prayer finishes, he drops to his knees and swings his fist into the naked guys balls, flooring him! The naked guy slowly comes to his senses and crawls out of the mosque.Confused, the marine asks the mosque leader what's going on... These men are thieves, rapists and murderers from all over Afghanistan. He says, Instead of prison, their punishment is to walk through the desert in nothing but their sandals, receive Allah's justice, then return home.The marine returns to his post and continues to watch these unusual punishments.After 6 long months of no bed, no clean water, no toilet and witnessing this unusual justice system, his replacement arrives.Hey, my last post was in Korea, how is it here? Asks the replacement. And what's with this queue of naked guys in the middle of nowhere!	?Well, I'll be honest with you, replies the marine, this a shit post, and what you're looking at here is a criminal punch line.

He found his way to the menswear department where a young lady offered to help him.Quiero calcetines, said the man.I don't speak Spanish, but we have some very nice suits over here, said the salesgirl.No, no quiero trajes. Quiero calcetines, said the man.Well, these shirts are on sale this week, declared the salesgirl.No, no quiero camisas. Quiero calcetines, repeated the man.I still don't know what you're trying to say. We have some fine pants on this rack, offered the salesgirl.No, no quiero pantalones. Quiero calcetines, insisted the man.These sweaters are top quality, the salesgirl probed.No, no quiero sueter. Quiero calcetines, said the man.Our undershirts are over here, fumbled the salesgirl, beginning to lose patience.No, no quiero camisetas. Quiero calcetines, the man repeated.As they passed the underwear counter, the man spotted a display of socks and happily grabbed a pair. Holding them up he proclaimed, Eso sí que es!Why didn't you just spell it in the first place?!	yelled the salesgirl.edit: [credit for the joke](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8c9cmw/a_mexican_man_who_spoke_no_english_went_into_a/
Today one of my friends told me I often make people uncomfortable by violating their personal space. 	It was an incredibly hurtful thing to say and it completely ruined our bath.
[Serious] Just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive. A few days ago I was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.Here's the joke I told:What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.Obviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown?No, replied the guy.	He choked on a sock.

How dare you use that kind of language around a Pastors wife!The guy behind the counter calms her down and says. No, no ma’am. This is a new breed of fish that live down at the local roller dam.

As a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: 5 lamb chops, please. Amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop.He follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, andtrot across the road to a bus-stop.The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench.When a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus.The butcher follows, dumbstruck.As the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery.After awhile he stands on his back paws to push the stop bell,then the butcher follows him off.The dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step.He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door.He does this again and again.	No answer.So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window,jumps off, and waits at the front door.A big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog.The butcher runs up and screams at the guy: What the hell are you doing?This dog's a genius!The owner responds, Genius, my ass.........It's the second time this week he's forgotten his keys!

Once upon a time there lived a beautiful Queen with large breasts. Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.The moral of the story - Pay your bills !	!

What a team is?The little boy nodded in the affirmative.Do you understand that what matters is not whether we win or lose, but how we play together as a team?The little boy nodded yes.So, the coach continued, I'm sure you know, when a penalty is called, you shouldn't argue, curse, attack the referee, or call him a pecker-head.Do you understand all that?Again the little boy nodded.He continued, And when I call you off the ice so that another boy gets a chance to play, it's not good sportsmanship to call your coach 'adumb a--hole', is it?Again the little boy nodded.Good, said the coach.	Now go over there and explain all that to your mother.

Father, do you have anything to declare? A beautiful young woman, on an international flight, asked the priest beside her, Father, may I ask a favor?Of course you may.

Is there anyway that you could carry it through Customs for me? Under your robes perhaps?I would love to help you, dear, but I must warn you: I will not lie.With your honest face, Father, no one will question you.When they got to Customs, the young lady let the priest go ahead of her.

An 85-year-old man was requested by his doctor for a sperm count as part of his physical exam. The doctor gave the man a jar and said, Take this jar home and bring back a semen sample tomorrow. The next day the 85-year-old man reappeared at the doctor's office and gave him the jar, which was as clean and empty as on the previous day. The doctor asked, what happened and the man explained. Well, doc, it's like this--first I tried with my right hand, but nothing. Then I tried with my left hand, but still nothing. Then I asked my wife for help. She tried with her right hand, then with her left, still nothing. She tried with her mouth, first with the teeth in, then with her teeth out, still nothing. We even called up Arleen, the lady next door and she tried too, first with both hands, then an armpit, and she even tried squeezin' it between her knees, but still nothing. The doctor was shocked!

A young Law student, having failed his Law exam, goes up to his crusty old professor, who is renowned for his razor-sharp legal mind. Student, Sir, do you really understand everything about this subject? Professor, Actually, I probably do. Otherwise I wouldn't be a professor, would I? Student, OK. So I'd like to ask you a question. If you can give me the correct answer, I will accept my marks as it is. If you can't give me the correct answer, however, you'll have to give me an A. Professor, Hmmmm, alright. So what's the question? Student, What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? The professor wracks his famous brain, but just can't crack the answer. Finally he gives up and changes the student's failing mark into an A as agreed, and the student goes away, very pleased. The professor continues to wrack his brain over the question all afternoon, but still can't get the answer. So finally he calls in a group of his brightest students and tells them he has a really, really tough question to answer, What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? To the professor's surprise (and embarrassment), all the students immediately raise their hands. All right, says the professor and asks his favorite student to answer.It's quite easy, sir says the student You see, you are 75 years old and married to a 30 year old woman, which is legal, but not logical. Your wife has a 22 year old lover, which is logical, but not legal.	And your wife's lover failed his exam but you've just given him an A, which is neither legal, nor logical.

Interactive joke. There was a man who lived in a 3 story house. **Remember: 3 stories. **The man entered the house and saw his wife making an omelette. He told her You're supposed to use butter, not oil. Immediately the wife slapped him and said Who's cooking? Me or or you?The man went up to the second story and saw his son playing a video game. He told him You're doing it wrong, you're supposed to- but the son slapped him, saying Who's playing? Me or you?Then he went to the third story and saw his daughter doing homework, and told her this is the wrong answer and the daughter slapped him, saying Who's doing homework? Me or you?Finally, the man went up to the fourth story. (At this point, hopefully your listener would say but you said there were only 3 stories! at which point you slap him/her and say Who's telling the joke? Me or you?	)**

An HR manager was knocked down (tragically) by a bus and was killed. Her soul arrived at the Pearly Gates, where St.Peter welcomed her. Before you get settled in he said, We have a little problem…you see, we’ve never had a HR manager make it this far before and we’re not really sure what to do with you.Oh, I see, said the woman, can’t you just let me in?Well, I’d like to, said St Peter, But I have higher orders. We’re instructed to let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you’d like to go for all eternity.Actually, I think I’d prefer heaven, said the woman. Sorry, we have rules… at which St. Peter put the HR manager into the downward bound elevator.As the doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times.They played a perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed a superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had a wonderful night telling jokes and dancing.Before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. Now it’s time to spend a day in heaven, he said.So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day’s end St. Peter returned. So, he said, You’ve spent a day in hell and you’ve spent a day in heaven. You must choose between the two.The woman thought for a second and replied: Well, heaven is certainly lovely, but I actually had a better time in hell. I choose Hell.Accordingly, St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her.I don’t understand, stuttered the HR manager, The other day I was here, and there was a golf course, and a country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had a wonderful happy time.	Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.The Devil simply looked at her and smiled, Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you’re staff.
A boy scout says to his scout leader, Sir, is this snake poisonous? The scout leader says, No, that snake's not poisonous at all.

Stormy Daniels and Queen Elizabeth went to the Pearly Gates on the same day.  They both met with an angel to find out if they would be admitted to Heaven.The angel said: Unfortunately, there's only one space available in Heaven today so I must decide which one of you will be admitted.The angel asked Stormy if there was some particular reason why she should go to Heaven. Stormy took off her top and said: Look at these, they're the most perfect breasts God ever created and I'm sure it will please God to be able to see them every day,for eternity.The angel thanked Stormy, and asked Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the same question.The Queen walked over to a toilet, pulled the lever and flushed it without saying a word.The Angel immediately said: Okay, your Majesty, you may go into Heaven.Stormy was outraged and asked, What was that all about? I showed you two of God's own perfect creations and you turned me down. She simply flushed a commode and she got admitted to Heaven!	Would you explain that to me?Sorry, Stormy, said the Angel, but even in Heaven, a royal flush beats a pair, no matter how big they are.
Once upon a time there lived a beautiful Queen with large breasts. Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.The moral of the story - Pay your bills !	!
Walking through the forest, an atheist hears a rustling in the bushes. Turning, he sees a massive grizzly charging towards him! He runs as fast as he can but trips over a stump and falls. As the bear raises a huge paw to strike, the atheist screams: God! Help me!Time freezes. The bear becomes immobile, the forest is silent, and the river stops running. Then the atheist hears a powerful voice: You have denied my existence for years, taught others I don’t exist and credited my creation to a cosmic accident. Why should I help you? It would be hypocritical to ask you to show mercy on me, the atheist agrees. But perhaps you could make the bear a Christian?	At that, the noise of the forest resumes, the river runs, and the bear drops to its knees, brings its paws together, and says, Lord, for this food which I am about to receive, I am truly thankful.

He yells down the stairs, Was I getting in or out of the bath?The 94 year old yells back, I don't know, I'll come up and see. He starts up the stairs and pauses, then he yells, Was I going up the stairs or coming down?The 92 year old was sitting at the kitchen table having coffee listening to his brothers.

As a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: 5 lamb chops, please. Amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop.He follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, andtrot across the road to a bus-stop.The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench.When a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus.The butcher follows, dumbstruck.As the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery.After awhile he stands on his back paws to push the stop bell,then the butcher follows him off.The dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step.He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door.He does this again and again.	No answer.So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window,jumps off, and waits at the front door.A big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog.The butcher runs up and screams at the guy: What the hell are you doing?This dog's a genius!The owner responds, Genius, my ass.........It's the second time this week he's forgotten his keys!

A cowboy, who just. moved to Montana from Texas, walks into a bar and orders three mugs of Bud. He sits in the back of the room, drinking a sip out of each one in turn. When he finishes them, he comes back to the bar and orders three more.The bartender approaches and tells the cowboy, You know, a mug goes flat after I draw it. It would taste better if you bought one at a time.The cowboy replies, Well, you see, I have two brothers.One is in Arizona , the other is in Colorado. When we all left our home in Texas, we promised that we'd drink this way to remember the days when we drank together. So I'm drinking one beer for each of my brothers and one for myself.The bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there.The cowboy becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the same way. He orders three mugs and drinks them in turn.One day, he comes in and only orders two mugs. All the regulars take notice and fall silent.	When he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, I don't want to intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my condolences on your loss.The cowboy looks quite puzzled for a moment, then a light dawns in his eyes and he laughs.Oh, no, everybody's just fine, he explains.It's just that my wife and I joined the Baptist Church and I had to quit drinking.It hasn't affected my brothers though.

A perfectly triangular lake has 3 kingdoms on its 3 sides. . The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.	And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

An engineer dies, and by some mistake he is sent to hell. Satan was unsure of why the engineer was sent down there, but he might as well be of use.

He demanded to speak with Satan.Why do you have this man when he lived righteously and has a place in heaven?

A farmer has 895 sheep. Realising that this is quite a lot of sheep for one farm, and Jess the sheepdog is getting a bit old, he decides he'll probably need a new dog- no, a whole team of dogs- to round so many sheep up.So the next day, the farmer goes to the pet store. He looks around at the various herding dogs- they seem very fit, but young and untrained. The shopkeeper asks the farmer if he wants any help.Why yes, says the farmer. I need a team of sheepdogs to help round up my flock. I have a rather large number of sheep, you see, and I don't think any of these young pups would be up to the task of rounding up so many.The shopkeeper says, I've got just the thing for you. and leads the farmer into a small back room, where a single sheepdog sits waiting.Are you sure? asks the farmer, I have very many sheep and I don't think one dog will be able to round all of them up..I'm sure. says the shopkeeper, This is a very intelligent dog. He's been well-trained for many jobs and has skills beyond any other dog I've ever seen.Yes, says the dog, I know six languages, eight martial arts and I have a degree in engineering.The farmer, clearly very impressed by this dog- who wouldn't be impressed by that?- decides to take him home.That afternoon, the farmer and the dog walk together up hill, and from the top they can see the entire flock covering the fields.Well, says the farmer, I'd like you to round up all of these sheep..Okay.	replies the dog, You have nine hundred sheep.

Three men, Joe, Bro, and Buddy, all lived in a small town. One day, Joe went hunting alone, and for the next few days no one heard from him. About a week afterwards, a body was found and brought into the coroner’s office. The coroner, after thoroughly examining the body, needed a positive identification in order to verify that the body was indeed Joe. So, he brought in Bro and Buddy, and told them to come in separately to identify the body. Bro came in first, and was asked to look for any details about the body that he recognized. After a few minutes of examining, Bro said, Mr. Coroner, I’ll need you to turn the body over for me to be sure.Confused, the coroner obliged. Bro continued to examine the body, bent down on one knee, reared his head sideways, then stood up and said, No sir, this can’t be Joe.The coroner was even more confused, but he accepted this statement and sent Bro out. Next, he invited Buddy in to repeat the task. Buddy, after examining the body in a similar fashion to Bro, also requested that the body be turned over.The coroner, after mumbling a bit about his confusion, flipped the body over. Buddy too bent down on one knee and examined the back area of the body, then, just as Bro had previously, said, No sir, Mr. Coroner, this isn’t Joe.The coroner was astonished, so he asked that Bro come back in so that the two of them were standing there at once. The coroner said, Gentlemen, this man’s dental records and features match perfectly with those of your friend Joe’s. How on earth are you both positive this isn’t him?Bro and Buddy looked at each other, then Bro answered, Sir, this can’t be Joe because Joe has two assholes.In shock, the coroner asked, How can he have two assholes?

On the lowest branch of a tree, there is a caterpillar looking at a bud. Hungrily, it says: I'll be damned if don't eat this bud. But I'll wait until it has bloomed so that I can go and fill my belly !! and then it waits patiently for the bud to bloom. Higher on that tree, a sparrow is looking at the caterpillar and says: I'll be damned if don't eat this caterpillar. But I'll wait until it has eaten the bud so that I can go and fill my belly!! and then it waits patiently for the caterpillar to eat the bud. Watching from another branch, a hawk hungrily looks at the sparrow and says: I'll be damned if don't eat this sparrow. But I will wait until it has eaten the caterpillar so that I can go and fill my belly. and then it waits patiently for the sparrow to eat the caterpillar.At the base of the tree, a cat is watching all this unfold and hungrily says:  I'll be damned if I don't eat this hawk. But I will wait until the hawk has eaten the sparrow so that I can go and fill my belly. and then waits for the right moment to jump on the hawk.A few moment pass and the bud starts to bloom.	Seeing this, the caterpillar goes and rushes for the bud, devouring the flower that started to bloom.Not wanting to miss his chance, the sparrow dives and goes for the caterpillar, eating it whole.With piercing eyes, the hawk reacts fast and swoops down on the sparrow, killing it with a swift strike.Having been preparing for a deadly attack on the hawk, the cat leaps on the branch and attempts to maul its prey.The total weight of the animals making the branch more frail, it breaks and the cat falls into a puddle of water.Moral of the story: the longer the build-up, the wetter the pussy.

A new twist on an old joke. Scientists recently did a study on the effects the right side and left side of a brain had on counting.They first took out the left half of a man's brain and asked him to count to 10. He says, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.They put the left half back in and removed the right half, asking him to count to 10 again. He says 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.Finally they decided to just go for it and removed the whole brain. They again asked him to count to 10 one more time.He says, Look. I'm great at counting to 10, ok? I love numbers and I have the best numbers. No one has better numbers than I do. My 4th grade math teacher - and let me tell you, she was the best and smartest math teacher in the country at the time - my 4th grade math teacher said to me that I am the best counter she's ever seen. The best. So if you want me to count to 10, let me tell you I can count to 10 alright. That's no problem. I will do it. I will.	And I will do it better than any has ever done it before, ok?

They were both very much in favor of it.The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before.

The husband was still feeling fine.The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%.

Three people die and appear before Buddha. Stunned by the divine presence before them, they lower their heads.-Raise your heads. You were humble in life and your deeds were praiseworthy. You have earned the right to a reincarnation of your choice. You have much to accomplish yet though.One of the people takes a step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled.-Benevolent Buddha, what more could I possibly do in my next life? I thought I lived and acted to the fullest. Because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve.-My work was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. Right now, the world I leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.-My connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.-I know all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that I ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation.The three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.-Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?-Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.-You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?-Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.-This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?-W-well, I don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.	(edit: obligatory editted thanks to the kind people who handed over silver & gold to my stupid joke

During WW2, three generals were arguing who had the bravest soldiers. The British general called one of his men over.Private! See that nazi tank in the minefield there? Go destroy it.Yes, Sir! The soldier replied and started running.He ran across the unmarked minefield until within range of the tank with his anti-tank weapon, took aim and fired, destroying the tank all the while under heavy fire from the enemy trenches.See, British soldiers are the bravest.That’s nothing said the Russian GeneralComrade! See that enemy soldier manning that machine gun there? Run across the mines into the trenches and kill him with a knife.Da, Comrade General!The russian soldier bravely charges across the minefield under heavy fire, jumped into the trenches fought his way through many enemy soldier then being shot many times from the machine gun nest before reaching that soldier and slicing his throat after a bloody brawl.Nobody more brave than Russian soldier.The American general, unimpressed said Let me show you all what real courage is.He calls one of his men over.Private! See that enemy command post over there? I want you to run naked across the minefields, fight your way through the trenches, go to the command post and kill the commanding officer bare handed!Without hesitation, the American soldier flips him the bird and saysGo fuck yourself, General.See!	Now that takes some real balls!
During my prostate exam, my doctor told me it’s perfectly normal to become aroused and even ejaculate. 	That being said, I still wish he hadn’t.
A sperm cell contains about 37.5 MB of information. There are about 100 million sperm cells per ml; the average ejaculation is about 2.25ml, and takes about 5 seconds. This makes the average bandwidth of the human penis 1687 TB/sec. 	I know, that's a lot of information to swallow
Men think about sex every 7 seconds... Which is why I eat hotdogs in under 6 seconds...	So it doesn't get weird.
A former Sergeant in the Marine Corps took a new job as a high school teacher.  Just before the school year started, he injured hisback. He was required to wear a plaster cast around the upperpart of  his body. Fortunately, the cast fit under his shirt andwasn't noticeable. On the first day of class, he found himself assigned tothe toughest students in the school. The smart punks, havingalready heard the new teacher was a former Marine, were leery of himand he knew they would be testing his discipline in the classroom. Walking confidently into the rowdy classroom, the newteacher opened the window wide and sat down at his desk. When astrong breeze made his tie flap, he picked up a stapler and stapledthe tie to his chest.	There was dead silence… the rest of the year went quite smoothly.
I asked my mom if by any chance i was adopted ? 	She said - why would we choose you..
This is the dirty joke my 85yo grandad told to our whole family by memory. A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship. The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink. They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore. At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him.	Look, she said, I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.
Once upon a time there lived a beautiful Queen with large breasts. Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.The moral of the story - Pay your bills !	!

A young Law student, having failed his Law exam, goes up to his crusty old professor, who is renowned for his razor-sharp legal mind. Student, Sir, do you really understand everything about this subject? Professor, Actually, I probably do. Otherwise I wouldn't be a professor, would I? Student, OK. So I'd like to ask you a question. If you can give me the correct answer, I will accept my marks as it is. If you can't give me the correct answer, however, you'll have to give me an A. Professor, Hmmmm, alright. So what's the question? Student, What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? The professor wracks his famous brain, but just can't crack the answer. Finally he gives up and changes the student's failing mark into an A as agreed, and the student goes away, very pleased. The professor continues to wrack his brain over the question all afternoon, but still can't get the answer. So finally he calls in a group of his brightest students and tells them he has a really, really tough question to answer, What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? To the professor's surprise (and embarrassment), all the students immediately raise their hands. All right, says the professor and asks his favorite student to answer.It's quite easy, sir says the student You see, you are 75 years old and married to a 30 year old woman, which is legal, but not logical. Your wife has a 22 year old lover, which is logical, but not legal.	And your wife's lover failed his exam but you've just given him an A, which is neither legal, nor logical.

[Serious] Just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive. A few days ago I was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.Here's the joke I told:What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.Obviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown?No, replied the guy.	He choked on a sock.

These are your  cars now! and hands the man all the car keys. Again, the atheist tries  to thank the devil, but he only says Everyone down here gets some cool  cars!

Two Aliens. Two aliens landed in the Arizona desert near a gas station that was closed for the night. They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien addressed it saying, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.The gas pump, of course, didn't respond.The younger alien became angry at the lack of response.The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you. 'The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response. Pissed at  the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said gruffly, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader or I will fire!The older alien again warned his comrade saying,  'You probably don't want to do that! I really think that will make him mad. ''Rubbish,' replied the cocky, young alien. He aimed his weapon  and opened fire. There was a huge explosion. A massive fireball roared towards him and blew the younger alien off his feet and threw him in a burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch.Half an hour passed. When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head. 'What a ferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien. 'He damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?	'The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, 'If there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you never mess with a guy who can loop his pen!s over his shoulder twice and then stick it in his ear.'

Donald Trump was visiting a primary school and he visited one of the classes. They were in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings. The teacher asked the President if he would like to lead the discussion on the word tragedy. So the illustrious leader asked the class for an example of a tragedy. One little boy stood up and offered: If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs over him and kills him, that would be a tragedy. No, said Trump, that would be an accident A little girl raised her hand: If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy. I’m afraid not, explained the president. That’s what we would call great loss. The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Trump searched the room. Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? Finally at the back of the room a small boy raised his hand... In a quiet voice he said: If ‘Air Force One’ was carrying you and was struck by a friendly fire missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy. Fantastic! exclaimed Trump. That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be tragedy?	Well, said the boy, It has to be a tragedy, because it certainly wouldn’t be a great loss, and it probably wouldn’t be a fucking accident either.

There was this tramp. One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.Coincidentally the father drives up. How can I ever thank you sir? he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.Ah, well... stammers the tramp, ... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.Oh dear, says the father, I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.No! No! says the tramp, Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.Ten pounds, thinks the tramp, I'm rich! I'm rich! and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. I'll have one holiday please!Ahem, which holiday would sir like? asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds, replies the tramp.TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds, says the girl incredulously.She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.Well you'll never believe it, she says to the tramp, back in the shop. I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.Yippee! exclaims the tramp, I'll take it!A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.Get off my ship ye dirty bum! shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.But I've got my ticket!, responds the tramp, super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!Well okay, says the captain, but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.Psst, says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6 pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3 deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.Sheer luxury! exclaimed the tramp, A room of my very own.I'm glad you like it, replies the captain, but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what a dive...!Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.That was amazing! exclaimed the captain, Where did you learn to dive like that?Um, well I've never actually dived before, replied the tramp.Well that's incredible! says the captain, I've never seen... He broke off. Hey, I've got an idea, he started again. How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!It's a deal! says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.Then one morning the captain comes to talk. Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.Okay, agreed the tramp.Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.Well, tramp, said the captain, shaking his hand, Let's see what you can do. And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...up and up...below him the ship grew smaller...on and on...past a solitary albatross...and still higher...till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...and on still further.../ till the ocean grew dim...and the earth itself...began to shrink...past our moon...and on...and Mars...and on...higher, and higher...through the asteroid belt...and on and on towards the diving board...past the outer planets, until...on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...he reached the board.He climbed on top and radioed the captain...and then....' '.. .. .he jumped.....:Slowly at first,:but speeding up,:::faster, and faster,:speeding past Pluto,:and the other outer planets,.........through the asteroid belt,past Mars,and the moon,faster,and faster,faster - ever faster,and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,faster, and faster,past the albatross,double-back somersault,and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,I CAN SEE HIM! yelled a passenger, LOOK!! !The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!DOWN!DOWN!THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!STILL DOWN...!DEEPER,DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,TILL.........SMASH!Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.Up and up, desperate, gasping...Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.HERO! WONDERFUL! AMAZING! GOOD SHOW THAT!And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.The tramp blushed.The captain went on, but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: Well you see...For me to tell you, I'll need $49.95The captain outrageously asked why.The tramp said The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes, As for cost, we selected initial values based upon data from the Open Beta and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch.

A teenage boy was delivering papers to an apartment house.  While there, a stunning young woman came out of the apartment next to the mailboxes wearing only a robe. The boy smiled at the young woman and she started up a conversation with him. As they talked, her robe slipped open, and it was obvious that she had nothing else on. The poor kid broke into a sweat trying to maintain eye contact.After a few minutes of flirting, she placed her hand on his arm and said, Let's go to my apartment, I hear someone coming.He followed her into her apartment; she closed the door and leaned against it, allowing her robe to fall off completely. Now nude, she purred at him, What would you say is my best feature?Flustered and embarrassed, he finally squeaked, It has to be your ears.Astounded, and a little hurt she asked, My ears? Look at these breasts; they are a full 38 inches and 100 percent natural. I work out every day and my ass is firm and solid. I have a 28 inch waist. Look at my skin, not a blemish anywhere.	How can you think that the best part of my body is my ears?Clearing his throat, he stammered, Outside, when you said you heard someone coming...that was me.

A sixteen year-old boy came home with a brand new Ford F150. His parents look at the truck and ask, Where did you get that truck?! I bought it today, he says.With what money? says his mother. They knew what a new F150 cost.Well, he says, this one cost me just fifteen dollars. The father looks at him like he's crazy. Who would sell a truck like that for fifteen dollars? he says.It was the lady up the street, says the boy. I don't know her name - they just moved in. She saw me ride past on my bike and asked me if I wanted to buy her F150 for fifteen dollars.Oh my Goodness! says the mother. Maybe she's mentally ill or has Alzheimer's something. John, you better go see what's going on. So the boy's father walks up the street to the house where the lady lives and finds her out in the yard calmly planting petunias.He introduces himself as the father of the boy to whom she had sold a new Ford F150 truck for fifteen dollars and asks to know why she did it.Well, she says, two days ago my husband left on a business trip. Yesterday I got a phone call from his boss and found out that he really ran off to Hawaii with his secretary and doesn't intend to come back.Oh, my goodness, I'm so sorry, the father says. But what does that have to do with my son and your truck?Well, this morning he called and told me he was stranded because he got robbed of his wallet with all his credit cards and cash. He told me to sell his new F150 and send him the money.	So I did.

A man walks out to the street and catches a taxi just going by. He gets into the taxi, and the cabbie says, Perfect timing. You're just like Frank. Passenger: Who? Cabbie: Frank Feldman. He's a guy who did everything right all the time. Like my coming along when you needed a cab, things happened like that to Frank Feldman every single time. Passenger: There are always a few clouds over everybody. Cabbie: Not Frank Feldman. He was a terrific athlete. He could have won the Grand-Slam at tennis. He could golf with the pros. He sang like an opera baritone and danced like a Broadway star and you should have heard him play the piano. He was an amazing guy. Passenger: Sounds like he was really something special. Cabbie: There's more. He had a memory like a computer. He remembered everybody's birthday. He knew all about wine, which foods to order and which fork to eat them with. He could fix anything. Not like me. I change a fuse, and the whole street blacks out. But Frank Feldman could do everything right. Passenger: Wow, what a guy! Cabbie: He always knew the quickest way to go in traffic and avoid traffic jams. Not like me, I always seem to get stuck in them. But Frank, he never made a mistake, and he really knew how to treat a woman and make her feel good. He would never answer her back even if she was in the wrong; and his clothing was always immaculate, shoes highly polished too. He was the perfect man! He never made a mistake. No one could ever measure up to Frank Feldman. Passenger: How did you meet him? Cabbie: I never actually met Frank.	He died and I married his wife.

The year is 1804 and a young man enlists on a ship.. ..his first voyage is to last 3 years, and even though the work is hard the young man takes to it like a fish in water.After only a few days he is running the riggin like an old hand, he swabs the decks without complaint and spends his free time in amicable companionship playing cards or telling tall tales.All in all the young man feels as if he has found his calling.A few weeks go by like this, the young man loving his new life except one part.. There are no women.After a couple of months like this, he is starting to feel extremely uncomfortable with the situation and voices his complaints to his shipmates one evening.Why don't you just use the barrel? Asks one of his mates with a surprised look .It turns out that down in the hold, in a dark corner there is a barrel, with a hole drilled into the side.. Whenever the sailors start to feel their urges rise, they simply go down to the barrel and take care of their business there.The young man decides, with some scepticism, to try the barrel, and finds to his surprise that it is a wholly pleasant experience, in no way lesser than any he has had with real women before.With this new found release the young man starts to enjoy his work even more. His days continue as before, and his evenings are still spent in pleasant company, but a new addition to his routine is a nightly visit to the barrel.Another two months pass in this way and all is well, until one night as he gets up from his seat at the card table and announces that he is going to visit the barrel to his mates.A few chuckles greet this announcement and one of his friends asks Trying to get the final fun out of it eh?Final fun? Are we getting rid of the barrel?	The young man asks, worry playing over his face.Not at all mate, it's just that.. next month is your turn in the barrel.

Donald Trump was visiting a primary school and he visited one of the classes. They were in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings. The teacher asked the President if he would like to lead the discussion on the word tragedy. So the illustrious leader asked the class for an example of a tragedy. One little boy stood up and offered: If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs over him and kills him, that would be a tragedy. No, said Trump, that would be an accident A little girl raised her hand: If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy. I’m afraid not, explained the president. That’s what we would call great loss. The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Trump searched the room. Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? Finally at the back of the room a small boy raised his hand... In a quiet voice he said: If ‘Air Force One’ was carrying you and was struck by a friendly fire missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy. Fantastic! exclaimed Trump. That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be tragedy?	Well, said the boy, It has to be a tragedy, because it certainly wouldn’t be a great loss, and it probably wouldn’t be a fucking accident either.
Two Aliens. Two aliens landed in the Arizona desert near a gas station that was closed for the night. They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien addressed it saying, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.The gas pump, of course, didn't respond.The younger alien became angry at the lack of response.The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you. 'The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response. Pissed at  the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said gruffly, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader or I will fire!The older alien again warned his comrade saying,  'You probably don't want to do that! I really think that will make him mad. ''Rubbish,' replied the cocky, young alien. He aimed his weapon  and opened fire. There was a huge explosion. A massive fireball roared towards him and blew the younger alien off his feet and threw him in a burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch.Half an hour passed. When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head. 'What a ferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien. 'He damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?	'The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, 'If there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you never mess with a guy who can loop his pen!s over his shoulder twice and then stick it in his ear.'

An ancient mathematical joke. Once upon a time, there were three kingdoms, all bordering on the same lake. For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner.The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage.	The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

A young Law student, having failed his Law exam, goes up to his crusty old professor, who is renowned for his razor-sharp legal mind. Student, Sir, do you really understand everything about this subject? Professor, Actually, I probably do. Otherwise I wouldn't be a professor, would I? Student, OK. So I'd like to ask you a question. If you can give me the correct answer, I will accept my marks as it is. If you can't give me the correct answer, however, you'll have to give me an A. Professor, Hmmmm, alright. So what's the question? Student, What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? The professor wracks his famous brain, but just can't crack the answer. Finally he gives up and changes the student's failing mark into an A as agreed, and the student goes away, very pleased. The professor continues to wrack his brain over the question all afternoon, but still can't get the answer. So finally he calls in a group of his brightest students and tells them he has a really, really tough question to answer, What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? To the professor's surprise (and embarrassment), all the students immediately raise their hands. All right, says the professor and asks his favorite student to answer.It's quite easy, sir says the student You see, you are 75 years old and married to a 30 year old woman, which is legal, but not logical. Your wife has a 22 year old lover, which is logical, but not legal.	And your wife's lover failed his exam but you've just given him an A, which is neither legal, nor logical.

As a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: 5 lamb chops, please.  Amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop.

After awhile he stands on his back paws to push the stop bell, then the butcher follows him off. The dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step. He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door. He does this again and again. No answer. So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window, jumps off, and waits at the front door. A big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog.

A farmer has 895 sheep.

He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.The moral of the story - Pay your bills !	!

If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each otherThe Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.The Rabbi pulled out an apple.With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue! 'Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.	'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'

Three girls all worked in the same office with the same female boss. Each day, they noticed the boss left work early. One day, the girls decided that, when the boss left, they would leave right behind her. After all, she never called or came back to work, so how would she know if they went home early? The brunette was thrilled to be home early. She did a little gardening, spent playtime with her son, and went to bed early. The redhead was elated to be able to get in a quick workout at the spa before meeting a dinner date. The blonde was happy to get home early and surprise her husband, but when she got to her bedroom, she heard a muffled noise from inside. Slowly and quietly, she cracked open the door and was mortified to see her husband in bed with her boss! Gently she closed the door and crept out of her house. The next day, at their coffee break,the brunette and redhead planned to leave early again,and they asked the blonde if she was going to go with them. No way, the blonde exclaimed.

Well, said the Englishman, At my local in London , the barman will buy you your third drink after you buy the first two. Ahhh, dat's nothin', said the Irishman, back home in my favorite pub, the moment you set foot in the place, they'll buy you a drink, then another, all the drinksyou like, actually.

And she noticed... What's wrong? Scarlett Johansson asked, Nothing... the guy would say...She pestered him for a while eventually saying she would do ANYTHING he needed or wanted to make him feel good again, just because she really cared for him a lot, and even if he wasn't asking, she felt it was the least she owed it to him...Really?, you'll do anything I'd like?yes she said anything!ok, first i want you to take off you toga and get into this pair of work jeans that somehow washed on the shoreok...now put this shirt on please, but first, tape your boobs so they are flatwha... ok, I'd say I'd do anything she said lovingly.ok, now, take this hat and wear it, but tuck your hair under itShe was kinda confused, but non the less, she wanted to make him happy, so she tucked her hair under the hat.Now id like for you to grab this piece of soot and paint yourself a beard and a mustacheok... if this is what you want... she muttered.now, please, put on these sunglasses, and start walking down the beach I'll catch up to you in a bit, he said a bit excited...She started walking... wondering... doubting herself... just confused about what had just happened, maybe it wasn't her, maybe it was h... suddenly the guy grabs her by her shoulder turns her around and says: DUDE!!!	you won't believe who I've been fucking for the past 6 months!

In a crowded city at a bus stop, a beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in a tight leather mini skirt, with matching tight leather boots and jacket... As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus. Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't! So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. With a coy little smile to the driver, she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step.About this time, a big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, How dare you touch my body!!	I don't even know who you are!At this, the Texan drawled, Well ma'am normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends.

A priest told me this joke as a kid. There were 3 men, they were best friends, and they were quite unhealthy. Their names were, Bert, Chester, and Earl.They were actually really unhealthy and Bert decided that he needed to take charge of him and his friends' health. He decided that they were going to be on a diet together to help them live for as long as possible. He broke the news to his friends, and they weren't too happy about it, but they decided to go along with it anyways, because they knew how out-of-shape they all were. It was tough for them all to stick to the plan at times, however they got through it together. They each lost between 120-140 pounds over the course of 20 years and were in amazing shape for their age.One day the 3 of them were given great news.Bert got a call, he answered it, then turned around to everyone and said: Guys! My daughter just had a child! I'm going to be a grandpa!. Everybody was celebrating for Bert when Earl got a call from his son. He answered it, and turned around to everybody and said:Guys! My son is going to get married today! I'm so excited!. Everybody was now celebrating for Bert and Earl, when Chester got a call. He answered it, turned around and said to everybody: Guys! My family is having a reunion today! I'm going to see so many people that I haven't seen in years!.They found out that the wedding, hospital, and park where the reunion was were all in the same town, and decided to carpool together to get there. It had snowed a little the day before and the roads were a little icy. As they were getting onto the highway, their car slipped and ran into a semi-truck. It killed all three of them.The three of them wake up together in heaven. They notice an angel standing over them and one of them asks Where are we?. The angels says: Congratulations, you made it to heaven. The angel decides to show them around the place and starts at a banquet. Here is a banquet for you three to enjoy, you've earned it. Chester looks a little sad, and Earl notices and asks him, What's wrong?. Chester finally speaks up, Okay, this is so nice of you to put together, but we're on a diet. I wouldn't want to overdo my calorie intake for the day. The angle replies to them, No worries, you can have as much food as you like without worrying about it. The guys are elated by that news, when the angel decides to show them another place.Next, the angel decides to show them a place where they can spend time having fun. He shows them to a massive building with games everywhere you look. There are at least 50 pool tables, 30 bowling alley lanes, people are playing poker, there are arcade games everywhere, and tons of people enjoying themselves. He tells them,This is where you may spend much of your time, if you choose. Many people enjoy it here and you might find some new friends. The guys really like this room, but Earl notices that Chester is looking sad again. Earls asks him,What's wrong?. Chester responds with,My wife left me because of my gambling problems, I don't want to disappoint anyone else because of it. I'm afraid I wont be able to enjoy this area. The angel then slightly irritated lets him know,Don't you see? There are no problems here. You don't have to worry about gambling issues, because money isn't an issue here. Chester is especially happy to hear that news, and the angel decides to show them where they are going to live.The angel finally takes them to the third place, and it is a huge mansion. The guys are led inside, when the angel says, This is where you three can live, if you choose to. Otherwise we have some other mansions, if you want to live alone. The guys are very intrigued by the house, they notice a big window on a wall with an amazing view. They could see for at least 5 miles clearly. They all can't help but gasp when looking through the window. Earl can't help but be concerned about this place. He decides to ask, So, uh... What's the rent here?. The angel looks back at them with an irritated glare are replies Nothing? It's free. Earl is sure to thank the angel and says,Wow! That's so kind of you guys!. Bert notices that Chester is looking a little sad. Bert says,What's wrong Chester? Isn't it amazing here?. Chester looks up, looks Bert in the eye and says a little mad, If it weren't for your goddamn diet. Bert.	We could've been here 20 years ago!.
An 85-year-old man was requested by his doctor for a sperm count as part of his physical exam. The doctor gave the man a jar and said, Take this jar home and bring back a semen sample tomorrow. The next day the 85-year-old man reappeared at the doctor's office and gave him the jar, which was as clean and empty as on the previous day. The doctor asked, what happened and the man explained. Well, doc, it's like this--first I tried with my right hand, but nothing. Then I tried with my left hand, but still nothing. Then I asked my wife for help. She tried with her right hand, then with her left, still nothing. She tried with her mouth, first with the teeth in, then with her teeth out, still nothing. We even called up Arleen, the lady next door and she tried too, first with both hands, then an armpit, and she even tried squeezin' it between her knees, but still nothing. The doctor was shocked! You asked your neighbor?	The old man replied, Yep, none of us could get the jar open.

I’ll handle this, I’m married to a blonde.	I speak blonde.He goes back to the blonde and whispers in her ear, and she says, Oh, I’m sorry and gets up and goes back to her seat in economy.The flight attendant and co-pilot are amazed and asked him what he said to make her move without any fuss.I told her, First class isn’t going to Sydney

A guy walks into a restaurant with a full-grown ostrich behind him.  The waitress asks for their orders. The guy says, A hamburger, fries, and a coke, and turns to the ostrich, What's yours?I'll have the same, says the ostrich.A short time later the waitress returns with the order. That will be $18.40 please. The man reaches into his pocket and, without looking, pulls out the exact change for payment.The next day, the guy and the ostrich come again and the guy says, A hamburger, fries, and a coke.The ostrich says, I'll have the same.Again the guy reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. This becomes routine until one night they enter the restaurant and the waitress asks, The usual?No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato, and salad, says the guy.Me too, says the ostrich.The waitress brings the order and says, That will be $42.62.Once again the guy pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. The waitress can't hold back her curiosity any longer. Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?Well, says the guy, several years ago I was cleaning my attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it a genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.That's brilliant! says the waitress. Most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!That's right.	Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there, says the guy.The waitress asks, But, sir, what's with the ostrich?The guy sighs and answers, My second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who agrees with everything I say.
I proposed my Russian girlfriend and she said Yes! For the wedding, my whole family and friends flew over to her home town of Moscow.It was a beautiful ceremony, however I did find some things strange. For instance, the priest never said, You may now kiss the bride, but I just assumed it was purely an American thing and didn't mind.Later during the reception, we were both starving and decided to head over to the buffet to get food. On the way we passed the drink table, where about six people were waiting to get a fruity drink from a bowl.As we passed, they all said in unison, You may now kiss the bride!	My wife got giddy and gave me a big kiss, which I of course returned.As we walked away I asked, Why did *they* tell us to kiss and not the priest?My wife answered,In Soviet Russia, the punchline tells you!

A politician dies. Instead of going straight to heaven or hell, a spirit appears to him. The spirit tells him that, rather than being judged for his sins, he gets to choose whether he goes to heaven or hell. The politician replies that of course he wants to go to heaven. The spirit tells him that before he chooses, he has to visit both places so each one will get a fair chance.First they visit heaven. It looks pretty nice. Big fluffy clouds, angels singing and playing harps, everyone seeming to enjoy themselves. The politician is pleased, if a bit underwhelmed.Hell, on the other hand, is magnificent. It’s the most beautiful place the politician has ever seen, and everyone there is having the time of their lives. It has a buffet table filled with delicious-smelling food, a beautiful garden, a pool with a water slide, a dance floor, a massage parlor, and innumerable other attractions. It makes heaven look dull and boring and comparison.I can’t believe I’m saying this, says the politician, but I think I’d rather go to hell! Very well, says the spirit. Turn around.When the politician turns around, though, hell appears to be completely different than it had been less than a minute ago. All of the attractions are gone, everything is on fire, and the people are screaming in agony.I don’t understand! cries the politician. This isn’t what you showed me before!Well, that was the campaign, replies the spirit.	Now you’ve voted.

Then we'll talk about the car The boy thought about that for a moment, decided he'd settle for the offer and they agreed on it.After about six weeks his father said, Son, you've brought your grades up and I've observed that you have been studying your Bible, but I'm disappointed you haven't had your hair cut.	The boy said, You know, Dad, I've been thinking about that, and I've noticed in my studies of the Bible that Samson had long hair, John the Baptist had long hair, Moses had long hair, and there's even strong evidence that Jesus had long hair.The father responded, Did you also notice that they all walked everywhere they went?

Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam. His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. What happened? he asked, exasperated.The old monk shook his head sadly. Isn't it obvious? he said. Sam sung Note 7.- EDIT - Wow, I came back and this really blew up! Thanks so much for the kind comments, and upvotes, and gold.	I'm so glad I could give so many people a chuckle today!

There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living... There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.The man was perfectly fine.Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just a bad conductor.

What do you call a waffle on a California beach? 	A Sandy Eggo.- Compliments of my cousin's 6 year old daughter (She says Hi by the way).-
A DEA agent stopped at our farm yesterday. We are going to need to search your land for illegally grown drugs.I said, that’s fine, but don’t go into that field over there. You won’t like it.Agitated by this, the officer explodes saying, do you see this god damn badge son?! This badge means I can go where I please, when I please, how I please! You have no authority when it comes to telling me where the fuck I can go! Have I made myself clear, boy? !I politely nodded and went back about my business. A short time after, I heard a scream, looked up to see the DEA agent being chased by my big old mean bull. Every step, gaining, closing the gap between himself and the agent. It seemed as tho he would surely get gored before returning to safety. The officer was clearly terrified. I threw down my tools, ran to the fence and screamed at the top of my lungs....YOUR BADGE! SHOW HIM YOUR FUCKIN BADGE!	!
In a crowded city at a bus stop, a beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in a tight leather mini skirt, with matching tight leather boots and jacket... As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus. Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't! So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. With a coy little smile to the driver, she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step.About this time, a big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, How dare you touch my body!!	I don't even know who you are!At this, the Texan drawled, Well ma'am normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends.
My mom thinks I need to stop objectifying women, I think she is overreacting. 	She asked why I broke up with the last girl and I saidIt didn't work out.She told me to be more specific so I saidI just told you, she didn't exercise.
A guy walks into a bar, followed by an ostrich, followed by a cat. All three sit down at the bar. The bartender looks at the man and says, What’ll ya have? The man says, Gimme a beer. The ostrich says, I’ll have one too. The cat says, I want two beers, but I’m only gonna pay half price. The bartender serves up four beers, and tells the man, that’ll be $12.67. The man reaches in his pocket and without even looking sets exact change down on the bar. After they finish their beers, the bartender asks, anything else? The man says, Gimme a shot of bourbon. The ostrich says, I’ll have one too. The cat says, I want a double bourbon, but I’m only gonna pay half price. The bartender serves them and says, That’s $14.03. The man reaches into his pocket and without even looking again sets exact change on the bar. After that round, the bartender says, What else will ya have? The man says, I need a Jack and Coke. The ostrich says, Me too! The cat says, I want two Jack and Cokes, and I’m only paying... Half price, I know, says the bartender. He sets them up and says, $16.38, please. The man reaches in his pocket a third time, and again sets exact change on the bar without counting it out. The bartender asks the man, How is it that every time you pay for your drink order, you can set exact change on the bar without looking? The man says, Well, some years ago I was walking on the beach in Egypt, and I found a magic lamp in the sand. I rubbed it, and a genie appeared and granted me three wishes for setting him free. So, with the first wish, I wished that no matter what I ever wanted to buy, I would always have exact change for it in my pocket.The bartender says, That’s brilliant! Most people would wish for a million or five million or whatever. This way, you’ll never run out of money, you don’t have to worry about carrying it, and you’ll never be robbed! Absolutely brilliant.The man says, I know, and thank you!The bartender says, So what did you ask for with your other two wishes?	The man said A chick with long legs and a tight pussy.
A guy walks into a restaurant with a full-grown ostrich behind him.  The waitress asks for their orders. The guy says, A hamburger, fries, and a coke, and turns to the ostrich, What's yours?I'll have the same, says the ostrich.A short time later the waitress returns with the order. That will be $18.40 please. The man reaches into his pocket and, without looking, pulls out the exact change for payment.The next day, the guy and the ostrich come again and the guy says, A hamburger, fries, and a coke.The ostrich says, I'll have the same.Again the guy reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. This becomes routine until one night they enter the restaurant and the waitress asks, The usual?No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato, and salad, says the guy.Me too, says the ostrich.The waitress brings the order and says, That will be $42.62.Once again the guy pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. The waitress can't hold back her curiosity any longer. Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?Well, says the guy, several years ago I was cleaning my attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it a genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.That's brilliant! says the waitress. Most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!That's right.	Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there, says the guy.The waitress asks, But, sir, what's with the ostrich?The guy sighs and answers, My second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who agrees with everything I say.

A male patient is lying in bed in the hospital, wearing an oxygen mask over his mouth and nose. A young student nurse appears and gives him a partial sponge bath.Nurse,' he mumbles from behind the mask, are my testicles black?Embarrassed, the young nurse replies, I don't know, Sir. I'm onlyhere to wash your upper body and feet.He struggles to ask again, Nurse, please check for me. Are mytesticles black?Concerned that he might elevate his blood pressure and heart rate from worrying about his testicles, she overcomes her embarrassment and pulls back the covers.She raises his gown, holds his manhood in one hand and his testicles gently in the other.She looks very closely and says, There's nothing wrong with them,Sir. They look fine.The man slowly pulls off his oxygen mask, smiles at her, and says very slowly, Thank you very much.	That was wonderful.Now listen very, very closely:Are - my - test - results - back?

The gynecologist who became a mechanic! A gynecologist had become fed up with malpractice insurance and HMO paperwork, and was burned out. Hoping to try another career where skillful hands would be beneficial, he decided to become a mechanic. He went to the local technical college, signed up for evening classes, attended diligently, and learned all he could. When the time of the practical exam approached, the gynecologist prepared carefully for weeks, and completed the exam with tremendous skill. When theresults came back, he was surprised to find that he had obtained a score of 150%. Fearing an error, he called the Instructor, saying, I don’t want to appear ungrateful for such an outstanding result, but I wonder if there is an error in the grade? The instructor said, During the exam, you took the engine apart perfectly, which was worth 50% of the total mark. You put the engine back together again perfectly, which is also worth 50% of the mark.	After a pause, the instructor added, I gave you an extra 50% because you did it all through the muffler, which I’ve never seen done in my entire career.

The year is 1804 and a young man enlists on a ship.. ..his first voyage is to last 3 years, and even though the work is hard the young man takes to it like a fish in water.After only a few days he is running the riggin like an old hand, he swabs the decks without complaint and spends his free time in amicable companionship playing cards or telling tall tales.All in all the young man feels as if he has found his calling.A few weeks go by like this, the young man loving his new life except one part..

His days continue as before, and his evenings are still spent in pleasant company, but a new addition to his routine is a nightly visit to the barrel.Another two months pass in this way and all is well, until one night as he gets up from his seat at the card table and announces that he is going to visit the barrel to his mates.A few chuckles greet this announcement and one of his friends asks Trying to get the final fun out of it eh?Final fun? Are we getting rid of the barrel?	The young man asks, worry playing over his face.Not at all mate, it's just that.. next month is your turn in the barrel.

Asks mathematician #2What kind of bar serves half-beers? The bartender remarks. That's ridiculous.Oh c'mon says mathematician #1 do you know how hard it is to collect an infinite number of us? Just play alongThere are very strict laws on how I can serve drinks. I couldn't serve you half a beer even if I wanted to.But that's not a problem mathematician #3 chimes in at the end of the joke you serve us a whole number of beers. You see, when you take the sum of a continuously halving function-I know how limits work interjects the bartenderOh, alright then.

An ancient mathematical joke. Once upon a time, there were three kingdoms, all bordering on the same lake. For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner.The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage.	The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

A woman joins a country club and when she hears the guys talking about their golf round, she says, I played on my college's golf team. I was pretty good. Mind if I join you next week? No one wants to say 'yes', but they're on the spot. Finally, one man says, Okay, but we start at 6:30 a.m.He figures the early tee-time will discourage her.The woman says this may be a problem and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late.They roll their eyes, but say, Okay.She's there at 6:30 am. sharp and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round.She's fun and pleasant and the guys are impressed.They congratulate her and invite her back the next week.She smiles, and says, I'll be there at 6:30, or 6:45.The next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp.Only this time, she plays left-handed.The three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand.They're totally amazed.They can't figure her out.She's very pleasant and a gracious winner.They invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.The third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys.This week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them.The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part.However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.This woman is a riddle no one can figure out.They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse and finally, one of the men asks her, How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?The lady blushes, and grins. When my dad taught me to play golf, I learned that I was ambidextrous. she replies. I like to switch back and forth.When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him.	If his willie points to the right, I golf right-handed; if it points to the left, I golf left-handed.The guys think this is hysterical.Astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys says, What if it's pointing straight up?She says, Then, I'm fifteen minutes late.

Their clothes are on the other side of the lake so they don't have time to retrieve them, they just have to make a run for it.

Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community... If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each otherThe Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.The Rabbi pulled out an apple.With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue! 'Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.	'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'

A married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine that would transfer a portion of the mother's labor pain to the father. He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it.The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine.The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him. The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain.	She and her husband were ecstatic.When they got home, the mailman was dead on the porch.

And she noticed... What's wrong?

Your DUCK IS DEAD. A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest.After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.The distressed woman wailed, Are you sure?Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead, replied the vet..How can you be so sure? she protested.. I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.The vet looked at the woman and said, I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. $1,500! she cried,$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!The vet shrugged, I'm sorry.	If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500.

An HR manager was knocked down (tragically) by a bus and was killed. Her soul arrived at the Pearly Gates, where St.Peter welcomed her. Before you get settled in he said, We have a little problem…you see, we’ve never had a HR manager make it this far before and we’re not really sure what to do with you.Oh, I see, said the woman, can’t you just let me in?Well, I’d like to, said St Peter, But I have higher orders. We’re instructed to let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you’d like to go for all eternity.Actually, I think I’d prefer heaven, said the woman. Sorry, we have rules… at which St. Peter put the HR manager into the downward bound elevator.As the doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times.They played a perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed a superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had a wonderful night telling jokes and dancing.Before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. Now it’s time to spend a day in heaven, he said.So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day’s end St. Peter returned. So, he said, You’ve spent a day in hell and you’ve spent a day in heaven. You must choose between the two.The woman thought for a second and replied: Well, heaven is certainly lovely, but I actually had a better time in hell. I choose Hell.Accordingly, St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her.I don’t understand, stuttered the HR manager, The other day I was here, and there was a golf course, and a country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had a wonderful happy time.	Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.The Devil simply looked at her and smiled, Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you’re staff.

The year is 1804 and a young man enlists on a ship.. ..his first voyage is to last 3 years, and even though the work is hard the young man takes to it like a fish in water.After only a few days he is running the riggin like an old hand, he swabs the decks without complaint and spends his free time in amicable companionship playing cards or telling tall tales.All in all the young man feels as if he has found his calling.A few weeks go by like this, the young man loving his new life except one part.. There are no women.After a couple of months like this, he is starting to feel extremely uncomfortable with the situation and voices his complaints to his shipmates one evening.Why don't you just use the barrel? Asks one of his mates with a surprised look .It turns out that down in the hold, in a dark corner there is a barrel, with a hole drilled into the side.. Whenever the sailors start to feel their urges rise, they simply go down to the barrel and take care of their business there.The young man decides, with some scepticism, to try the barrel, and finds to his surprise that it is a wholly pleasant experience, in no way lesser than any he has had with real women before.With this new found release the young man starts to enjoy his work even more.

Donald Trump was visiting a primary school and he visited one of the classes. They were in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings. The teacher asked the President if he would like to lead the discussion on the word tragedy. So the illustrious leader asked the class for an example of a tragedy. One little boy stood up and offered: If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs over him and kills him, that would be a tragedy. No, said Trump, that would be an accident A little girl raised her hand: If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy. I’m afraid not, explained the president. That’s what we would call great loss. The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Trump searched the room. Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? Finally at the back of the room a small boy raised his hand... In a quiet voice he said: If ‘Air Force One’ was carrying you and was struck by a friendly fire missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy. Fantastic! exclaimed Trump. That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be tragedy?	Well, said the boy, It has to be a tragedy, because it certainly wouldn’t be a great loss, and it probably wouldn’t be a fucking accident either.

A real delicacy! The cowboy said, What the heck, bring me an order. The waiter replied, I am so sorry, Señor. There is only one serving per day because there is only one bull fight each morning. If you come early and place your order, we will be sure to save you this delicacy. The next morning, the cowboy returned, placed hisorder, and that evening was served the one and only special delicacy of the day. After a few bites, inspecting his platter, he called to the waiter and said, These are delicious, but they are much, much smaller than the ones I saw you serve yesterday. The waiter shrugged his shoulders and replied, Si, Señor.	Sometimes the bull wins.

A policeman was interrogating 3 guys who were training to become detectives. To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first guys a picture for 5 seconds and then hides it. This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?The first guy answers, That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye! The policeman says, Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile.Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?The second guy smiles, flips his hair, and says, Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!The policeman angrily responds, What's the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, This is your suspect, how would you recognize him? He quickly adds, Think hard before giving me a stupid answer.The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, the suspect wears contact lenses.The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not. Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that. He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?That's easy, the third guy replied.	He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear.

Unbutton my blouse.. A successful rancher died and left everything to his devoted wife. She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand... Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk. She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.. For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well. Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels. The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night. One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return. Two o'clock and no hired hand. Finally he returned around two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him. She quietly called him over to her.. Unbutton my blouse and take it off, she said. Trembling, he did as she directed. Now take off my boots. He did as she asked, ever so slowly.. Now take off my socks. He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots. Now take off my skirt. He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light. Now take off my bra.. Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.	Then she looked at him and said, If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired.

A woman was in bed with her lover when she heard her husband opening the front door. Hurry! she said, stand in the corner. She quickly rubbed baby oil all over him and then she dusted him with talcum powder. Don't move until I tell you to, she whispered. Just pretend you're a statue.What's this, honey? the husband inquired as he entered the room.Oh, it's just a statue, she replied nonchalantly. The Smiths bought one for their bedroom. I liked it so much, I got one for us too.

Two Aliens. Two aliens landed in the Arizona desert near a gas station that was closed for the night. They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien addressed it saying, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.The gas pump, of course, didn't respond.The younger alien became angry at the lack of response.The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you. 'The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response. Pissed at  the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said gruffly, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader or I will fire!The older alien again warned his comrade saying,  'You probably don't want to do that! I really think that will make him mad. ''Rubbish,' replied the cocky, young alien. He aimed his weapon  and opened fire. There was a huge explosion. A massive fireball roared towards him and blew the younger alien off his feet and threw him in a burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch.Half an hour passed. When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head. 'What a ferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien. 'He damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?	'The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, 'If there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you never mess with a guy who can loop his pen!s over his shoulder twice and then stick it in his ear.'

4 years ago today, I shared the worst joke I ever created. Here it is again for those that missed it. There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted. About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off. The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak. The grim reaper swears. Oh no! This always happens with identical twins. What do you mean? asks the dentist. Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now. The dentist is noticeably upset. He says Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life. The grim reaper asks What do you have in mind? The dentist thinks. How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free. The grim reaper laughs. I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose? The dentist smiles. I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide. Very well says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom. Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance. The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles. It's unbelievable. The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth. The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. You win, human. This time. Your brother will live. He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died. The dentist smiles on the phone and says. That's interesting, bro.	Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.

[Serious] Just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive. A few days ago I was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.Here's the joke I told:What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me.

So, the other one is a Mommy Longlegs? she asked.The father's heart soared with the joy of such a cute and innocent question. He laughed, and then replied, No sweetheart. Both of them are Daddy Longlegs.The little girl, looking a little puzzled, thought for a moment, then lifted her foot and stomped the spiders flat.

Man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.You're in the afterlife! he tells the man, But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.What are the odds? they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line. The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. Come, the beggar told him, I'll take you to the evening meal. So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line, and then he added, and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. What is it, he thought, that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here? That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.The beggar laughed jovially. I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in! Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. That's the line for the dragon meat, he said before turning to the next line, and that's the line for angeldust stew, then he paused, confused.What is it?	the man asked his old friend.The beggar replied, There appears to be no punchline.

That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.The man says, All right, all right. I’m dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 pebbles on the earth.The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk.

He says, Real funny.	May I have the key?The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.The man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.
So two aliens find their way to earth.  They land in the Arizona desert near a gas station that was closed for the night. They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien addressed it saying, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.The gas pump, of course, didn't respond.The younger alien became angry at the lack of response.The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you. 'The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response.Pissed at  the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said gruffly, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader or I will fire!The older alien again warned his comrade saying,  'You probably don't want to do that! I really think that will make him mad. ''Rubbish,' replied the cocky, young alien. He aimed his weapon  and opened fire. There was a huge explosion. A massive fireball roared towards him and blew the younger alien off his feet and threw him in a burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch.Half an hour passed. When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head. 'What a ferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien. 'He damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?	'The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, 'If there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you never mess with a guy who can loop his dick over his shoulder twice and then stick it in his ear.'

An ancient mathematical joke. Once upon a time, there were three kingdoms, all bordering on the same lake. For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner.The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage.	The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

Finally, one man says, Okay, but we start at 6:30 a.m.He figures the early tee-time will discourage her.The woman says this may be a problem and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late.They roll their eyes, but say, Okay.She's there at 6:30 am. sharp and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round.She's fun and pleasant and the guys are impressed.They congratulate her and invite her back the next week.She smiles, and says, I'll be there at 6:30, or 6:45.The next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp.Only this time, she plays left-handed.The three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand.They're totally amazed.They can't figure her out.She's very pleasant and a gracious winner.They invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.The third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys.This week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them.The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part.However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.This woman is a riddle no one can figure out.They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse and finally, one of the men asks her, How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?The lady blushes, and grins. When my dad taught me to play golf, I learned that I was ambidextrous. she replies. I like to switch back and forth.When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him.	If his willie points to the right, I golf right-handed; if it points to the left, I golf left-handed.The guys think this is hysterical.Astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys says, What if it's pointing straight up?She says, Then, I'm fifteen minutes late.

Three people die and appear before Buddha. Stunned by the divine presence before them, they lower their heads.-Raise your heads. You were humble in life and your deeds were praiseworthy. You have earned the right to a reincarnation of your choice. You have much to accomplish yet though.One of the people takes a step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled.-Benevolent Buddha, what more could I possibly do in my next life? I thought I lived and acted to the fullest. Because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve.-My work was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. Right now, the world I leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.-My connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.-I know all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that I ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation.The three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.-Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?-Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.-You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?-Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.-This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?-W-well, I don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.	(edit: obligatory editted thanks to the kind people who handed over silver & gold to my stupid joke
A Priest, a thief, a Jewish schoolboy and Irishman die in a car crash... They stand before Saint Peter at the gates of heaven. Saint Peter looks at them and appears confused. My children he says There has been a mistake, you were not supposed to die today. I will allow you one more chance at life as long as you promise to love out the rest of your existence free of sin. Eager to return to their lives the men all agree, and *POOF* they appear back on Earth. They stand awestruck, wondering if what they had just experienced was real or just a dream. The thief notices a woman walking with an expensive looking purse. Convinced that he had only imagined the gates of heaven he rushes and attempts to steal the purse and *POOF* he disappears. Realizing what just happened the others understand that they must truly live without sin. The Irishman looks to his left and sees a pub. One drink won't hurt he says as he orders a pint. He lifts the cup to his lips and *POOF* he disappears. The Jewish schoolboy looks down and sees a coin that fell from the vanishing Irishman's pocket.	He bends down to pick it up, fully aware that greed is a sin, and *POOF* the priest disappears.

Scarlett Johansson and some guy were the only survivors of a shipwreck. They didn't know each other before the shipwreck, but he did know who she was...At the beginning it was hard, but as time passed, this guy learnt how to provide food and shelter, he started taking care of her, and eventually she started caring about him... after all, there wasn't anybody else in the island...He eventually built a cabin, had a functioning automatic potable water supply, and all sorts of little clever commodities, all done to make her life easier... it was the most effort any man had ever done for her, and all the hard work made him fit, she noticed this...One night after some wildlife attacked and he defended her successfully, getting a few cuts in the process, she threw herself at him and they made love, after that, they where for all intents and purposes a couple with an above regular sex life.But for some reason he started drifting away, something was bothering him. And she noticed... What's wrong? Scarlett Johansson asked, Nothing... the guy would say...She pestered him for a while eventually saying she would do ANYTHING he needed or wanted to make him feel good again, just because she really cared for him a lot, and even if he wasn't asking, she felt it was the least she owed it to him...Really?, you'll do anything I'd like?yes she said anything!ok, first i want you to take off you toga and get into this pair of work jeans that somehow washed on the shoreok...now put this shirt on please, but first, tape your boobs so they are flatwha... ok, I'd say I'd do anything she said lovingly.ok, now, take this hat and wear it, but tuck your hair under itShe was kinda confused, but non the less, she wanted to make him happy, so she tucked her hair under the hat.Now id like for you to grab this piece of soot and paint yourself a beard and a mustacheok... if this is what you want... she muttered.now, please, put on these sunglasses, and start walking down the beach I'll catch up to you in a bit, he said a bit excited...She started walking... wondering... doubting herself... just confused about what had just happened, maybe it wasn't her, maybe it was h... suddenly the guy grabs her by her shoulder turns her around and says: DUDE!!!	you won't believe who I've been fucking for the past 6 months!
NSFW - A mother was walking down the hall when she heard a humming sound coming from her daughter's bedroom. When she opened the door she found her daughter naked on the bed with a vibrator. What are you doing? she exclaimed. The daughter replied, I'm 35 and still living at home with my parents and this is the closest I'll ever get to a husband.Later that week the father was in the kitchen and heard a humming sound coming from the basement. When he went downstairs, he found his daughter naked on the sofa with her vibrator. What are you doing? he exclaimed.The daughter replied, I'm 35 and still living at home with my parents and this is the closest I'll ever get to a husband.A couple of days later the mother heard the humming sound again, this time in the living room. In there, she found her husband watching the Super Bowl on television with the vibrator buzzing away beside him.What are you doing? she exclaimed.	He replied............Watching the game with my son-in-law.

Five friends were sitting around, debating which Pixar movie is the greatest. After a few hours of debate, no one was willing to concede, and it was decided that a vote must be held. Unfortunately, with so few friends present, it was clear that they would need to bring the vote to the greater public. The group decided that each friend would make a plea to the subreddit of their choice, and whoever received the most karma for it would win.Adam, already undecided himself, decided to go to /r/AskReddit. He laid out the agreement, and asked that everyone vote one their favorite movie, and the one with the most votes he would use for the his friends. Unfortunately, as the votes were split in that sub, his highest post amounted to a mere 38 points.Paul, a big proponent for the Toy Story franchise, posted to /r/nostalgia in the hopes that everyone who grew up with Toy Story would agree. Unfortunately, as there had been two sequels (with a third on the way) it wasn't exactly considered nostalgia and he got downvoted into oblivion.Bill, who loved Monsters Inc., made his case using some trickery. Going to /r/news, he found a seemingly unrelated post, and made a top-level comment describing, in great detail, why Monsters Inc. was the greatest film of all time. The fact that the post was so out of context made everyone flock to it, and drew enough attention to new him over a thousand fake internet points.Mike, who loved the Incredibles movies, decided to stay in his wheelhouse. Over the course of several hours, he created each of the family members from the Incredibles in Soulcaliber VI. Finally, he photoshopped the family together, and posted it to /r/gaming. Under normal circumstances this would have skyrocketed to the top, but the format was stale, and thus only received 20k karma. Still, Mike was confident in his victory.While the other four friends came up with plans on how to maximize their karma gains, Chris sat silently. For hours he sat, making no posts, coming up with no original content. Finally, an hour before the deadline, he broke into his neighbor's house, stealing his copy of the Pixar movie Up. He took a picture of his theft and posted it directly to /r/Jokes with the title STOLEN.When the group got together the next day to see who got the most votes, everyone was in awe. Chris's post had over 40,000 points. How did you know that would win? Easy, Chris replied.	Everyone knows stolen content on /r/Jokes gets all the Up votes.

An atheist dies and goes to hell. The devil welcomes him and says:Let me show you around a little bit.They walk through a nice park with green trees and the devil shows him a huge palace.

The devil says:No need to say thank you, everyone gets a nice place to live in when they come down here!They continue walking through the nice park, flowers everywhere, and the devil shows the atheist a garage full of beautiful cars. These are your cars now! and hands the man all the car keys. Again, the atheist tries to thank the devil, but he only says Everyone down here gets some cool cars! How would you drive around without having cars?.They walk on and the area gets even nicer. There are birds chirping, squirrels running around, kittens everywhere.They arrive at a fountain, where the most beautiful woman the atheist has ever seen sits on a bench. She looks at him and they instantly fall in love with each other. The man couldn´t be any happier. The devil says Everyone gets to have their soulmate down here, we don´t want anyone to be lonely!As they walk on, the atheist notices a high fence. He peeks to the other side and is totally shocked.

A man walks into a bar and orders a beer. After having the beer, he asks the bartender for the bill. $3, says the bartender. The man just for fun goes on and places a $1 coin on the three ends of the table. The bartender gives him a bad look but has no other option but to pick them up. This happened for 3-4 days and everyday the bartender felt humiliated. The next day, he orders a beer but couldn't find three $1 coins to pay the bill. So, he hands the bartender a $5 note. Now, the bartender gets all excited and thinks that it is his day to avenge the hard time he had because of this man.	He then places the two $1 coins at the opposite ends of the table.Now, with a shrewd smile and with all the excitement he goes to the man and says, Go on, collect your change.The man then takes out a $1 coin from his pocket and puts it in front of the bartender and says, One more beer please.

Scotsman, Englishman, and an Irishman walk into a bar. Sitting in a bar the Scotsman says, As good as this bar is, I still prefer the pubs back home. In Glasgow, there's a wee place. The landlord goes out of his way for the locals. When you buy four drinks, he'll buy the fifth drink. Well, said the Englishman, At my local in London , the barman will buy you your third drink after you buy the first two. Ahhh, dat's nothin', said the Irishman, back home in my favorite pub, the moment you set foot in the place, they'll buy you a drink, then another, all the drinksyou like, actually.

NSFW In honor of my Father, his favorite joke of all time. No one could tell it like he did. Christmas was coming and Little Johnny’s Mom and Dad took him to the mall to a see Santa Claus.Johnny walked up and sat on Santa’s lap and said Santa, for Christmas I want a god damn new baseball bat and I want it to be put under my god damn bed. I want a god damn new baseball glove, and I want it put under the god damn Christmas tree. And Santa, I want a god damn new bike and I want it put under a god damn tarp in the god damn shed.Santa, in complete shock, pulled Little Johnny’s parents aside and said In all my years, I have never seen a little boy with such a foul mouth.His parents replied We know, but we have no idea what to do about his behavior. We’ve tried everything.Santa thought about it and said Here’s what we’ll do to teach him a lesson, every place that Johnny asked for a present, we’ll put a pile of dog poop. The parents agreed to try Santa’s plan.On Christmas morning, Little Johnny woke up and immediately looked under his bed. Seeing the pile of poop, he ran downstairs to the Christmas tree and checked underneath.Finding another pile of poop under the tree, he ran out the door and threw open the shed door. Finding a tarp in the shed, he quickly pulled back the tarp and found yet another pile of poop.Johnny walked out of the shed and started looking all around the yard.	After a while his parents asked him sarcastically So Little Johnny, what did you get for Christmas?Without missing a beat, Johnny looked at his parents and said I think I got a god damned dog, but I can’t find the motherfucker!

Two married buddies are out drinking one night, when one turns to the other and says... You know, I don't know what else to do. Whenever I go home after we've been out drinking, I turn the headlights off before I get to the driveway. I shut off the engine and coast into the garage. I take my shoes off before I go into the house, I sneak up the stairs, I get undressed in the bathroom. I ease into bed and my wife STILL wakes up and yells at me for staying out so late!His buddy looks at him and says, Well, you're obviously taking the wrong approach. I screech into the driveway, slam the door, storm up the steps, throw my shoes into the closet, jump into bed, rub my hands on my wife's ass and say, 'How about a blowjob?'	... and she's always sound asleep.

May I ask you a question?	Why did you take the quarters instead of the dollar bill?’ The boy licked his cone and replied, ‘Because the day I take the dollar, the game is over!’

Donald Trump was visiting a primary school and he visited one of the classes. They were in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings. The teacher asked the President if he would like to lead the discussion on the word tragedy. So the illustrious leader asked the class for an example of a tragedy. One little boy stood up and offered: If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs over him and kills him, that would be a tragedy. No, said Trump, that would be an accident A little girl raised her hand: If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy. I’m afraid not, explained the president. That’s what we would call great loss. The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Trump searched the room. Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? Finally at the back of the room a small boy raised his hand... In a quiet voice he said: If ‘Air Force One’ was carrying you and was struck by a friendly fire missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy. Fantastic! exclaimed Trump. That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be tragedy?	Well, said the boy, It has to be a tragedy, because it certainly wouldn’t be a great loss, and it probably wouldn’t be a fucking accident either.

On the first day of class, he found himself assigned tothe toughest students in the school.

A new twist on an old joke. Scientists recently did a study on the effects the right side and left side of a brain had on counting.They first took out the left half of a man's brain and asked him to count to 10. He says, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.They put the left half back in and removed the right half, asking him to count to 10 again. He says 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.Finally they decided to just go for it and removed the whole brain. They again asked him to count to 10 one more time.He says, Look. I'm great at counting to 10, ok? I love numbers and I have the best numbers. No one has better numbers than I do. My 4th grade math teacher - and let me tell you, she was the best and smartest math teacher in the country at the time - my 4th grade math teacher said to me that I am the best counter she's ever seen. The best. So if you want me to count to 10, let me tell you I can count to 10 alright. That's no problem. I will do it. I will.	And I will do it better than any has ever done it before, ok?

A policeman was interrogating 3 guys who were training to become detectives. To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first guys a picture for 5 seconds and then hides it. This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?The first guy answers, That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye! The policeman says, Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile.Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?The second guy smiles, flips his hair, and says, Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!The policeman angrily responds, What's the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, This is your suspect, how would you recognize him? He quickly adds, Think hard before giving me a stupid answer.The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, the suspect wears contact lenses.The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not. Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that. He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?That's easy, the third guy replied.	He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear.

An HR manager was knocked down (tragically) by a bus and was killed. Her soul arrived at the Pearly Gates, where St.Peter welcomed her. Before you get settled in he said, We have a little problem…you see, we’ve never had a HR manager make it this far before and we’re not really sure what to do with you.Oh, I see, said the woman, can’t you just let me in?Well, I’d like to, said St Peter, But I have higher orders. We’re instructed to let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you’d like to go for all eternity.Actually, I think I’d prefer heaven, said the woman. Sorry, we have rules… at which St. Peter put the HR manager into the downward bound elevator.As the doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times.They played a perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed a superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had a wonderful night telling jokes and dancing.Before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. Now it’s time to spend a day in heaven, he said.So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day’s end St. Peter returned. So, he said, You’ve spent a day in hell and you’ve spent a day in heaven. You must choose between the two.The woman thought for a second and replied: Well, heaven is certainly lovely, but I actually had a better time in hell. I choose Hell.Accordingly, St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her.I don’t understand, stuttered the HR manager, The other day I was here, and there was a golf course, and a country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had a wonderful happy time.	Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.The Devil simply looked at her and smiled, Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you’re staff.

The pastor asked if anyone in the congregation would like to express praise for answered prayers.Suzie Smith stood and walked to the podium.She said, I have a praise.Two months ago, my husband, Tom, had a terrible bicycle wreck and his scrotum was completely crushed. The pain was excruciating and the doctors didn't know if they could help him. (You could hear a muffled gasp from the men in the congregation as they imagine the pain that poor Tom must have experienced. )Tom was unable to hold me or the children, she went on, and every move caused him terrible pain.We prayed as the doctors performed a delicate operation, and it turned out they were able to piece together the crushed remnants of Tom's scrotum, and wrap wire around it to hold it in place. (Again, the men in the congregation cringed and squirm uncomfortably as they imagined the horrible surgery performed on Tom. )Now, she announced in a quivering voice, thank the Lord, Tom is out of the hospital and the doctors say that with time, his scrotum should recover completely. (All the men sighed with unified relief. )The pastor rose and tentatively asked if anyone else had something to say.A man slowly stood up and walked just as slowly to the podium.He said, I'm Tom Smith.	The entire congregation held its breath.I just want to tell my wife -- the word is sternum.

Unbutton my blouse.. A successful rancher died and left everything to his devoted wife. She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand... Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk. She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.. For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well. Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels. The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night. One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return. Two o'clock and no hired hand. Finally he returned around two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him. She quietly called him over to her.. Unbutton my blouse and take it off, she said. Trembling, he did as she directed. Now take off my boots. He did as she asked, ever so slowly.. Now take off my socks. He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots. Now take off my skirt. He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light. Now take off my bra.. Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.	Then she looked at him and said, If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired.

The farmer and his wife needed a new bull... There was a man who lived on a farm with his wife in the middle of nowhere. All they owned was a truck, a few cows, and an old bull. They didn't have much, but they were happy. One day, the farmer woke up and found that the bull had died. He went to his wife and said, I take our money into the town and buy us a new bull. I know you need the truck here to keep the farm running, so when I get us a bull, I'll send you a telegraph so you know when to pick us up.His wife went and got the money and then said goodbye.The farmer arrived in town late that day and had to get a hotel room. The next morning he only had 401 dollars left. He went to the market and was able to buy a strong, young bull with the 400 dollars. It had been a long time since he had been to town, but as long as the telegraph prices hadn't gone up, he should be able to send a full sentence to his wife with his dollar.When he arrived at the post office, he said to the telegraph operator: I need to send a message to my wife so she can pick up my bull and I. How much is a word?Prices went up a few years ago, replied the operator. A word is 1 dollar.Oh no, said the farmer I can only send one word! He thought for a little while and then said, Ok, send my wife the word 'comfortable.'Comfortable? Are you sure? asked the operator.My wife has a 4th grade education, the farmer replied. When she reads she has to sound each word out syllable by syllable.	So when she sees the word comfortable, she'll read it as 'come-for-ta-bull.'
This is the dirty joke my 85yo grandad told to our whole family by memory. A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship. The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink. They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore. At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him.	Look, she said, I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.

One day, Einstein has to speak at an important science conference.On the way there, he tells his driver that looks a bit like him: I'm sick of all these conferences. I always say the same things over and over!The driver agrees: You're right. As your driver, I attended all of them, and even though I don't know anything about science, I could give the conference in your place. That's a great idea! says Einstein. Let's switch places then! So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it. But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.	The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says : Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.
A Mom visits her son for dinner who lives with a girl roommate.  A Mom visits her son for dinner who lives with a girl roommate.During the course of the meal, his mother couldn't help but notice how pretty his roommate was. She had long been suspicious of a relationship between the two, and this had only made her more curious.Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between him and his roommate than met the eye.Reading his mom's thoughts, the son volunteered, I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, we are just roommates.About a week later, his roommate came to him saying, Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the silver plate. You don't suppose she took it, do you?He said ,Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just to be sure.He sat down and wrote :Dear Mother:I'm not saying that you ‘did' take the silver plate from my house, I'm not saying that you ‘did not' take the silver plate .. But the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.Love,your sonSeveral days later, he received an email from his Mother which read:Dear Son:I'm not saying that you ‘do' sleep with your roommate, and I'm not saying that you ‘do not' sleep with her.	But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her OWN bed, she would have found the silver plate by now, under the pillow…Love,Mom.﻿

What starts with f and ends with k? A first-grade teacher, Ms. Brooks, was having trouble with one of her more precocious students. The teacher asked, Harry, what exactly is your problem?Harry answered, I'm too smart for the 1st grade. My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she! I think I should be in the 3rd grade, too!Ms. Brooks finally had enough; she took Harry to the principal's office. While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the situation to the principal. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave. She agreed.Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he happily agreed to take the test.Principal:  What is 3 x 3?Harry:  9.Principal:  What is 6 x 6?Harry:  36.And so it went with every question the principal thought a bright 3rd grader should know.The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, Y’know, I reckon Harry can go to the 3rd grade.But Ms. Brooks is still skeptical of the little bugger and says to the principal, Not so fast, let me ask him a few questions.The principal and Harry both agree. Ms. Brooks asks, What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?Harry, after a moment:  Legs.Ms. Brooks:  What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?The principal wondered why would she ask such a question!Harry replied:  Pockets. to the Principal’s great relief. Ms. Brooks:  What does a dog do that a man steps into?Harry:  Pants.By now, the principal is sitting forward with his mouth hanging open.Ms. Brooks:  What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?Now the principal's eyes open really wide and before he could intervene, Harry replied, Bubble gum.Ms. Brooks:  What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?Harry:  Shake hands.The principal is now trembling with apprehension as Ms. Brooks asks the last question.Ms.	Brooks:  What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' and indicates a great deal of heat and excitement?Harry: Firetruck.The principal breaths a huge sigh of relief and tells the teacher, Put the little bastard in 5th Grade; I got the last seven questions wrong myself.

He floored it to 140 , then 150, then 155, and 160…Suddenly he thought, Shit man, I'm too old for this nonsense! So he pulled over to the side of the road and waited for the cop to catch up with him. The officer walked up to him, looked at his watch and said, Sir, my shift ends in ten minutes. And guess what, today is Friday and I'm taking off for the weekend with my family to the beach.

This is the dirty joke my 85yo grandad told to our whole family by memory. A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship. The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink. They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore. At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him.	Look, she said, I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.
not for the easily offended - one of my favorites. Guy and his two buddies are at a bar, when one of them nudges the other two. See those three women over there?

Back at the table, he asks her if she's got a ride home.She tells him, no but I can call someone to pick me up.Trying to be nice he tells her nonsense I'll give you a ride!On the ride they're laughing and getting along well and she tells him, I'm really enjoying spending time with you and am not ready for the night to end yet, why don't you pull over at that park and we can talk.They pull over and are talking for a while, when she finally kisses him.I'm sorry, she blushes, you're just so nice and I like you.it's perfectly fine. he smiles.Would you like to make love to me? she asks.	He agrees and they start going at it, but with her legs it's hard to do in the truck.She thinks and says, My arms are pretty strong, why don't you take me to the Monkey bars, I can hang and we can do it that way.So they go at it, finish up and he drives her home.After he wheels her to the door her dad comes out.Come here boy, he says, gesturing him over.Worried, he walks over, uhh yes sir?I just wanted to thank you for driving her, that was damn decent of you and I haven't seen her smile like that in years.Feeling guilty, he says, It's no big deal I was glad to do it.No no, her father replies, you don't understand, you're a good man, most guys just leave her hanging in the park.

As a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: 5 lamb chops, please.  Amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop. He follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and trot across the road to a bus-stop. The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench. When a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus. The butcher follows, dumbstruck. As the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery. After awhile he stands on his back paws to push the stop bell, then the butcher follows him off. The dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step. He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door. He does this again and again. No answer. So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window, jumps off, and waits at the front door. A big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog. The butcher runs up and screams at the guy: What the hell are you doing? This dog's a genius! The owner responds, Genius, my ass.........	It's the second time this week he's forgotten his keys!

A guy walks into a restaurant with a full-grown ostrich behind him.  The waitress asks for their orders. The guy says, A hamburger, fries, and a coke, and turns to the ostrich, What's yours?I'll have the same, says the ostrich.A short time later the waitress returns with the order. That will be $18.40 please. The man reaches into his pocket and, without looking, pulls out the exact change for payment.The next day, the guy and the ostrich come again and the guy says, A hamburger, fries, and a coke.The ostrich says, I'll have the same.Again the guy reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. This becomes routine until one night they enter the restaurant and the waitress asks, The usual?No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato, and salad, says the guy.Me too, says the ostrich.The waitress brings the order and says, That will be $42.62.Once again the guy pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table.

How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?Well, says the guy, several years ago I was cleaning my attic and found an old lamp.

Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there, says the guy.The waitress asks, But, sir, what's with the ostrich?The guy sighs and answers, My second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who agrees with everything I say.

I took my daughter out for her first drink... While reading an article about fathers and sons drinking together, I remembered the time I took my daughter out for her first drink. Off we went to our local bar only two blocks from the house. I got her a Guinness. She didn't like it, so I drank it. Then I got her a Killian's she didn't like that either, so I drank it. Finally, I thought she might like some Harp Lager? She didn't. I drank it. I thought maybe she'd like whiskey better than beer so we tried a Jameson's; nope! In desperation, I had her try that 25 year old Glenfiddich. The bar's finest scotch. She wouldn't even smell it. What could I do but drink it!

A coach is looking after a young ice hockey team. At one point during a game, the coach called one of his 7-year-old hockey players aside and asked, Do you understand what cooperation is? What a team is?The little boy nodded in the affirmative.Do you understand that what matters is not whether we win or lose, but how we play together as a team?The little boy nodded yes.So, the coach continued, I'm sure you know, when a penalty is called, you shouldn't argue, curse, attack the referee, or call him a pecker-head.Do you understand all that?Again the little boy nodded.He continued, And when I call you off the ice so that another boy gets a chance to play, it's not good sportsmanship to call your coach 'adumb a--hole', is it?Again the little boy nodded.Good, said the coach.	Now go over there and explain all that to your mother.

On the lowest branch of a tree, there is a caterpillar looking at a bud. Hungrily, it says: I'll be damned if don't eat this bud. But I'll wait until it has bloomed so that I can go and fill my belly !! and then it waits patiently for the bud to bloom. Higher on that tree, a sparrow is looking at the caterpillar and says: I'll be damned if don't eat this caterpillar. But I'll wait until it has eaten the bud so that I can go and fill my belly!! and then it waits patiently for the caterpillar to eat the bud. Watching from another branch, a hawk hungrily looks at the sparrow and says: I'll be damned if don't eat this sparrow. But I will wait until it has eaten the caterpillar so that I can go and fill my belly. and then it waits patiently for the sparrow to eat the caterpillar.At the base of the tree, a cat is watching all this unfold and hungrily says:  I'll be damned if I don't eat this hawk. But I will wait until the hawk has eaten the sparrow so that I can go and fill my belly. and then waits for the right moment to jump on the hawk.A few moment pass and the bud starts to bloom.	Seeing this, the caterpillar goes and rushes for the bud, devouring the flower that started to bloom.Not wanting to miss his chance, the sparrow dives and goes for the caterpillar, eating it whole.With piercing eyes, the hawk reacts fast and swoops down on the sparrow, killing it with a swift strike.Having been preparing for a deadly attack on the hawk, the cat leaps on the branch and attempts to maul its prey.The total weight of the animals making the branch more frail, it breaks and the cat falls into a puddle of water.Moral of the story: the longer the build-up, the wetter the pussy.

One day in the future, Donald Trump has a heart-attack and dies. He immediately goes to Hell, where the devil is waiting for him. I don't know what to do here, says the devil.You are on my list, but I have no room for you. You definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I've got three folks here who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU decide who leaves.Donald thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room.In it, was Richard Nixon and a  large pool of water. Nixon kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed. Over, and over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. Such was his fate in  hell.No, Donald said. I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and it would ruin my hair. I don't think I could do that all day  long.The devil led him to the door of the next room. In it, was Ronald Reagan with a sledge-hammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that  hammer, time after time after time. No, this is no good; I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day, commented Donald.The devil opened a third door. Through it, Donald saw Bill Clinton, lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head, and his legs restrained in a spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.	Donald looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said, Yeah man, I can handle this.The devil smiled and said, Okay: Monica, you're free to go.

Interactive joke. There was a man who lived in a 3 story house. **Remember: 3 stories. **The man entered the house and saw his wife making an omelette. He told her You're supposed to use butter, not oil. Immediately the wife slapped him and said Who's cooking? Me or or you?The man went up to the second story and saw his son playing a video game. He told him You're doing it wrong, you're supposed to- but the son slapped him, saying Who's playing? Me or you?Then he went to the third story and saw his daughter doing homework, and told her this is the wrong answer and the daughter slapped him, saying Who's doing homework? Me or you?Finally, the man went up to the fourth story. (At this point, hopefully your listener would say but you said there were only 3 stories! at which point you slap him/her and say Who's telling the joke? Me or you?	)**

Men's Helpline. Hello, you have reached the Men's Help Line, my name is Bob. How can I help you?Hi Bob, I really need your advice on a serious problem. I have suspected for some time now that my wife has been cheating on me. You know, just the usual signs: The phone rings and when I answer, the caller hangs up. Plus, she goes out with the girls a lot. I usually try to stay awake to look out for her when she comes home, but I always fall asleep. Anyway, last night about midnight, I woke up and she was not home. So, I hid in the garage, behind my boat and waited for her. When she came home, she got out of someone's car, buttoning her blouse. Then she took her panties out of her purse and slipped them on. It was at that moment, while crouching behind the boat, that I noticed a hairline crack in the outboard motor mounting bracket.	Is that something I can weld, or do I need to replace the whole bracket?

Otherwise, you let me off with a warning. Sound fair?The officer ponders it shortly before nodding his head. Sounds fair. Can you step out of the car please?Just as the lawyer steps out and shuts the car door, the officer pulls out his baton and starts beating the lawyer.	After a few swings, the officer says, Now, would you like me to stop or slow down?

There was this tramp. One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.Coincidentally the father drives up. How can I ever thank you sir? he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.Ah, well... stammers the tramp, ... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.Oh dear, says the father, I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.No! No! says the tramp, Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.Ten pounds, thinks the tramp, I'm rich! I'm rich! and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. I'll have one holiday please!Ahem, which holiday would sir like? asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds, replies the tramp.TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds, says the girl incredulously.She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.Well you'll never believe it, she says to the tramp, back in the shop. I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.Yippee! exclaims the tramp, I'll take it!A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.Get off my ship ye dirty bum! shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.But I've got my ticket!, responds the tramp, super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!Well okay, says the captain, but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.Psst, says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6 pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3 deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.Sheer luxury! exclaimed the tramp, A room of my very own.I'm glad you like it, replies the captain, but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what a dive...!Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.That was amazing! exclaimed the captain, Where did you learn to dive like that?Um, well I've never actually dived before, replied the tramp.Well that's incredible! says the captain, I've never seen... He broke off. Hey, I've got an idea, he started again. How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!It's a deal! says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.Then one morning the captain comes to talk. Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.Okay, agreed the tramp.Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.Well, tramp, said the captain, shaking his hand, Let's see what you can do. And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...up and up...below him the ship grew smaller...on and on...past a solitary albatross...and still higher...till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...and on still further.../ till the ocean grew dim...and the earth itself...began to shrink...past our moon...and on...and Mars...and on...higher, and higher...through the asteroid belt...and on and on towards the diving board...past the outer planets, until...on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...he reached the board.He climbed on top and radioed the captain...and then....' '.. .. .he jumped.....:Slowly at first,:but speeding up,:::faster, and faster,:speeding past Pluto,:and the other outer planets,.........through the asteroid belt,past Mars,and the moon,faster,and faster,faster - ever faster,and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,faster, and faster,past the albatross,double-back somersault,and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,I CAN SEE HIM! yelled a passenger, LOOK!! !The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!DOWN!DOWN!THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!STILL DOWN...!DEEPER,DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,TILL.........SMASH!Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.Up and up, desperate, gasping...Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.HERO! WONDERFUL! AMAZING! GOOD SHOW THAT!And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.The tramp blushed.The captain went on, but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: Well you see...For me to tell you, I'll need $49.95The captain outrageously asked why.The tramp said The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes, As for cost, we selected initial values based upon data from the Open Beta and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch.	Among other things, we’re looking at average per-player credit earn rates on a daily basis, and we’ll be making constant adjustments to ensure that players have challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via gameplay.We appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on Reddit, our forums and across numerous social media outlets.Our team will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update everyone as soon and as often as we can.
A man escapes from a prison where he's been locked up for 15 years. He breaks into a house to look for money and guns. Inside, he finds a young couple in bed. He orders the guy out of bed and ties him to a chair. While tying the homeowner's wife to the bed, the convict gets on top of her, kisses her neck, then gets up and goes into the bathroom. While he's in there, the husband whispers over to his wife: Listen, this guy is an escaped convict. Look at his clothes! He's probably spent a lot of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in years. I saw how he kissed your neck. If he wants sex, don't resist, don't complain... do whatever he tells you. Satisfy him no matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is obviously very dangerous. If he gets angry, he'll kill us both. Be strong, honey. I love you! His wife responds: He wasn't kissing my neck. He was whispering in my ear. He told me that he's gay, thinks you're cute, and asked if we had any Vaseline. I told him it was in the bathroom. Be strong honey.	I love you, too!

So, the other one is a Mommy Longlegs? she asked.The father's heart soared with the joy of such a cute and innocent question. He laughed, and then replied, No sweetheart.

Three people die and appear before Buddha. Stunned by the divine presence before them, they lower their heads.-Raise your heads. You were humble in life and your deeds were praiseworthy. You have earned the right to a reincarnation of your choice. You have much to accomplish yet though.One of the people takes a step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled.-Benevolent Buddha, what more could I possibly do in my next life? I thought I lived and acted to the fullest. Because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve.-My work was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. Right now, the world I leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.-My connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.-I know all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that I ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation.The three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.-Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?-Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.-You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?-Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.-This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?-W-well, I don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.	(edit: obligatory editted thanks to the kind people who handed over silver & gold to my stupid joke

Tom's scrotum.  The pastor asked if anyone in the congregation would like to express praise for answered prayers.Suzie Smith stood and walked to the podium.She said, I have a praise.Two months ago, my husband, Tom, had a terrible bicycle wreck and his scrotum was completely crushed. The pain was excruciating and the doctors didn't know if they could help him. (You could hear a muffled gasp from the men in the congregation as they imagine the pain that poor Tom must have experienced. )Tom was unable to hold me or the children, she went on, and every move caused him terrible pain.We prayed as the doctors performed a delicate operation, and it turned out they were able to piece together the crushed remnants of Tom's scrotum, and wrap wire around it to hold it in place. (Again, the men in the congregation cringed and squirm uncomfortably as they imagined the horrible surgery performed on Tom. )Now, she announced in a quivering voice, thank the Lord, Tom is out of the hospital and the doctors say that with time, his scrotum should recover completely. (All the men sighed with unified relief. )The pastor rose and tentatively asked if anyone else had something to say.A man slowly stood up and walked just as slowly to the podium.He said, I'm Tom Smith.	The entire congregation held its breath.I just want to tell my wife -- the word is sternum.

A DEA agent stopped at our farm yesterday. We are going to need to search your land for illegally grown drugs.I said, that’s fine, but don’t go into that field over there.

You have no authority when it comes to telling me where the fuck I can go! Have I made myself clear, boy? !I politely nodded and went back about my business. A short time after, I heard a scream, looked up to see the DEA agent being chased by my big old mean bull. Every step, gaining, closing the gap between himself and the agent. It seemed as tho he would surely get gored before returning to safety. The officer was clearly terrified. I threw down my tools, ran to the fence and screamed at the top of my lungs....YOUR BADGE! SHOW HIM YOUR FUCKIN BADGE!	!

[Serious] Just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive. A few days ago I was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.Here's the joke I told:What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me.

Me or you?Then he went to the third story and saw his daughter doing homework, and told her this is the wrong answer and the daughter slapped him, saying Who's doing homework? Me or you?Finally, the man went up to the fourth story.

He's been well-trained for many jobs and has skills beyond any other dog I've ever seen.Yes, says the dog, I know six languages, eight martial arts and I have a degree in engineering.The farmer, clearly very impressed by this dog- who wouldn't be impressed by that?- decides to take him home.That afternoon, the farmer and the dog walk together up hill, and from the top they can see the entire flock covering the fields.Well, says the farmer, I'd like you to round up all of these sheep..Okay.	replies the dog, You have nine hundred sheep.

The gynecologist who became a mechanic! A gynecologist had become fed up with malpractice insurance and HMO paperwork, and was burned out.

He went to the local technical college, signed up for evening classes, attended diligently, and learned all he could. When the time of the practical exam approached, the gynecologist prepared carefully for weeks, and completed the exam with tremendous skill. When theresults came back, he was surprised to find that he had obtained a score of 150%. Fearing an error, he called the Instructor, saying, I don’t want to appear ungrateful for such an outstanding result, but I wonder if there is an error in the grade? The instructor said, During the exam, you took the engine apart perfectly, which was worth 50% of the total mark. You put the engine back together again perfectly, which is also worth 50% of the mark.	After a pause, the instructor added, I gave you an extra 50% because you did it all through the muffler, which I’ve never seen done in my entire career.

Walking through the forest, an atheist hears a rustling in the bushes. Turning, he sees a massive grizzly charging towards him! He runs as fast as he can but trips over a stump and falls. As the bear raises a huge paw to strike, the atheist screams: God! Help me!Time freezes. The bear becomes immobile, the forest is silent, and the river stops running. Then the atheist hears a powerful voice: You have denied my existence for years, taught others I don’t exist and credited my creation to a cosmic accident. Why should I help you? It would be hypocritical to ask you to show mercy on me, the atheist agrees. But perhaps you could make the bear a Christian?	At that, the noise of the forest resumes, the river runs, and the bear drops to its knees, brings its paws together, and says, Lord, for this food which I am about to receive, I am truly thankful.

One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it.

With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear.

Little Bobby was running through the woods.  behind his house when the urge to go #2 struck. Bobby did his business behind a tree and carried on his way. The next day, Bobby was out behind his house again when he saw a swarm of flies circling yesterday's droppings. Intrigued, Bobby dropped his pants and did his business in the exact same spot in hopes of seeing how many flies he could gather. After a couple weeks of doing this, Bobby had created a rather tall pile of dung. So tall, in fact, that he now needed to use a step ladder to make sure he had a stable poo-pole developing. A curious neighbor caught sight of Bobby doing this, and after confronting Bobby, the neighbor punched Bobby in the face and told him to grow the hell up. Over the next few days, word of Bobby's droppings had spread around town. It started with just a few people a day coming up to Bobby, punching him in the face, and telling him the errs of his way. It wasn't long until there was a line of over 50 people waiting to see Bobby's poo-pole and to subsequently punch him in the face. The line moved pretty slowly, however, and someone towards the back of the line had to take care of some business of his own. Not wanting to leave his spot, he dropped his pants answered nature's call right then and there. The stench of his droppings spread quickly throughout the line. One gentleman towards the front of the line caught its stench when he saw Bobby's creation, admiration spreading across his face.	The man at the front of the line turned around and said that was a good shit post, but this punchline stinks.

A politician dies. Instead of going straight to heaven or hell, a spirit appears to him. The spirit tells him that, rather than being judged for his sins, he gets to choose whether he goes to heaven or hell. The politician replies that of course he wants to go to heaven. The spirit tells him that before he chooses, he has to visit both places so each one will get a fair chance.First they visit heaven. It looks pretty nice. Big fluffy clouds, angels singing and playing harps, everyone seeming to enjoy themselves. The politician is pleased, if a bit underwhelmed.Hell, on the other hand, is magnificent. It’s the most beautiful place the politician has ever seen, and everyone there is having the time of their lives. It has a buffet table filled with delicious-smelling food, a beautiful garden, a pool with a water slide, a dance floor, a massage parlor, and innumerable other attractions. It makes heaven look dull and boring and comparison.I can’t believe I’m saying this, says the politician, but I think I’d rather go to hell! Very well, says the spirit. Turn around.When the politician turns around, though, hell appears to be completely different than it had been less than a minute ago. All of the attractions are gone, everything is on fire, and the people are screaming in agony.I don’t understand! cries the politician. This isn’t what you showed me before!Well, that was the campaign, replies the spirit.	Now you’ve voted.

Still it's not good enough for him, so yet again he mutters fuck, I missed!The priest bursts out, yelling my son! The Lord will strike you down should you continue in your sinful ways! You will be punished for your sins! The sailor apologizes profusely and lines up his putt. The putt heads straight for the hole... and then runs around the rim and stays out. FUCK!

Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards.He listened a while longer, and said, There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling. So the magistrate kept listening; There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about.	It's just Beethoven decomposing.

Balls.. A big Texan stopped at a local restaurant following a day roaming around in Mexico. While sipping his tequila, he noticed a sizzling, scrumptious looking platter being served at the next table. Not only did it look good, but the smell was wonderful. He asked the waiter, What is that you just served? The waiter replied, Ah, Señor, you have excellent taste! Those are called Cojones de Toro, bull's testicles from the bull fight this morning. A real delicacy! The cowboy said, What the heck, bring me an order. The waiter replied, I am so sorry, Señor. There is only one serving per day because there is only one bull fight each morning. If you come early and place your order, we will be sure to save you this delicacy. The next morning, the cowboy returned, placed hisorder, and that evening was served the one and only special delicacy of the day. After a few bites, inspecting his platter, he called to the waiter and said, These are delicious, but they are much, much smaller than the ones I saw you serve yesterday. The waiter shrugged his shoulders and replied, Si, Señor.	Sometimes the bull wins.

What starts with f and ends with k? A first-grade teacher, Ms. Brooks, was having trouble with one of her more precocious students. The teacher asked, Harry, what exactly is your problem?Harry answered, I'm too smart for the 1st grade. My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she! I think I should be in the 3rd grade, too!Ms. Brooks finally had enough; she took Harry to the principal's office.

She agreed.Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he happily agreed to take the test.Principal:  What is 3 x 3?Harry:  9.Principal:  What is 6 x 6?Harry:  36.And so it went with every question the principal thought a bright 3rd grader should know.The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, Y’know, I reckon Harry can go to the 3rd grade.But Ms. Brooks is still skeptical of the little bugger and says to the principal, Not so fast, let me ask him a few questions.The principal and Harry both agree. Ms. Brooks asks, What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?Harry, after a moment:  Legs.Ms. Brooks:  What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?The principal wondered why would she ask such a question!Harry replied:  Pockets. to the Principal’s great relief. Ms. Brooks:  What does a dog do that a man steps into?Harry:  Pants.By now, the principal is sitting forward with his mouth hanging open.Ms. Brooks:  What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?Now the principal's eyes open really wide and before he could intervene, Harry replied, Bubble gum.Ms. Brooks:  What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?Harry:  Shake hands.The principal is now trembling with apprehension as Ms. Brooks asks the last question.Ms.	Brooks:  What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' and indicates a great deal of heat and excitement?Harry: Firetruck.The principal breaths a huge sigh of relief and tells the teacher, Put the little bastard in 5th Grade; I got the last seven questions wrong myself.

A professional gambler wins big and dies of an aneurysm.

He taps the old man ahead of him on the shoulder...Want to make a bet while we wait? The Gambler asks. If I can guess your last words in three tries, you have to let me cut ahead of you.The old man, having nothing better to do, agrees. Immediately, the gambler begins reading him like the pro player he is. He notices the elderly Asian man's shirt is open, exposing a pair of defibrillator marks.Don't be silly, it's just indigestion. the gambler remarks.

But then other people started chipping in, shouting stuff like How do you sleep at night? and You’re a total disgrace.Next thing I knew the manager was standing right beside me, throwing in his two pence worth as well. I remember what he said to the letter. He said: In 25 years I’ve never seen anything like this.So I said: I know I’m not much to look at but that’s a bit harsh, isn’t it? But he wasn’t listening, he was just waving his arms saying he was going to throw me out and that security was on its way.At that point I just thought Oh, I don’t need this.So I stood up and said: Fuck it, come on kids we’re leaving.

An ancient mathematical joke. Once upon a time, there were three kingdoms, all bordering on the same lake. For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner.The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage.	The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

A deep, booming voice from the heavens speaks... FUCK!	I MISSED!
An atheist dies and goes to hell. The devil welcomes him and says:Let me show you around a little bit.They walk through a nice park with green trees and the devil shows him a huge palace.

Other devils are skinning people alive, heads are spiked, and many more terrible things are happening.	A stench of sulfur is in the air.Terrified, the man stumbles backwards, and asks the devil What is going on there?The devil just shrugs and says: Those are the christians, I don´t know why, but they prefer it that wayedit: fucked up punchline, thanks to u/Tjurit for pointing ou

He's been well-trained for many jobs and has skills beyond any other dog I've ever seen.Yes, says the dog, I know six languages, eight martial arts and I have a degree in engineering.The farmer, clearly very impressed by this dog- who wouldn't be impressed by that?- decides to take him home.That afternoon, the farmer and the dog walk together up hill, and from the top they can see the entire flock covering the fields.Well, says the farmer, I'd like you to round up all of these sheep..Okay.	replies the dog, You have nine hundred sheep.

That’s what we would call a great loss.The room goes silent. Trump searches the room. Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? Finally at the back of the room, little Johnny raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says, If Air Force One, carrying you was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens; that would be a tragedy.Fantastic! exclaimed Mr. Trump. That’s right.	And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?Well’, said little Johnny, because it sure as hell wouldn’t be a great loss and probably wouldn’t be an accident either.

There's a little-known legend about Attila the Hun... The story goes that Attila used to collect exotic animals that he found during his conquests. He particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was a giant snake. He was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign.But his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet.Wishing to save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent.	Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.Curious, Attila did as he asked.Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.Now hold these in both hands, he instructed.Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.To an amazed Attila, the old man simply said,Thy anaconda don't want nun unless you've got buns, Hun.

[Serious] Just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive. A few days ago I was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.Here's the joke I told:What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.Obviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said I'm so sorry to hear that.

A guy walks into a restaurant with a full-grown ostrich behind him.  The waitress asks for their orders. The guy says, A hamburger, fries, and a coke, and turns to the ostrich, What's yours?I'll have the same, says the ostrich.A short time later the waitress returns with the order. That will be $18.40 please. The man reaches into his pocket and, without looking, pulls out the exact change for payment.The next day, the guy and the ostrich come again and the guy says, A hamburger, fries, and a coke.The ostrich says, I'll have the same.Again the guy reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. This becomes routine until one night they enter the restaurant and the waitress asks, The usual?No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato, and salad, says the guy.Me too, says the ostrich.The waitress brings the order and says, That will be $42.62.Once again the guy pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table.

How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?Well, says the guy, several years ago I was cleaning my attic and found an old lamp.

Most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!That's right.	Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there, says the guy.The waitress asks, But, sir, what's with the ostrich?The guy sighs and answers, My second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who agrees with everything I say.

So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living. He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said, Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just a bad conductor.

A couple want to have children but the wife can't get pregnant.   ...so they go to see a priest for advice. The priest tells them they came at the right time, since his superior just sent him to Rome for 10 years, and he's leaving tomorrow. 'As soon as I'll get there, I'll immediately light a candle for you,' he promises. Time passes and the priest returns to the little town after 10 years. The first thing he does is visit the couple's home. He can hear a crazy loud noise when he knocks on the door. The wife opens the door; three little children on her arms, a couple of them hiding under her skirt, and others behind her playing around. The priest counts as many as ten of them! 'Well this is quite a pleasant surprise,' exclaims the priest. 'It seems like God listened to my prayer. But where is your dear husband?' 'My husband traveled to Rome,' says the wife with a tired look on her face. 'To Rome? Why on earth would he go to Rome?'	'To blow out that bloody candle you lit!'

Better yet, all of our old friends who died before us are here, too. Better than that, we're all young again. Better still, it's always spring time and it never rains or snows. And best of all, we can play football all we want, and we never get tired.That's fantastic, says Mike. It's beyond my wildest dreams!

Stoner Joke. Three Men Died and Went to Hell Where They Met the Devil. (Warning! Long one) Three men died and went to hell where they met the Devil. The Devil told them that they had sinned in life and therefore had to spend the next 666 years in hell to atone for their sins. However, since the Devil wasn't entirely merciless, he would let them choose for themselves how they were going to spend those 666 years. And so the Devil let the men to three doors.Going through the first door, they entered what looked to be a normal bar. Although, if you were there for more than an hour, you would notice that no matter how much you tried to drink another bottle would appear on the shelf. And even better, the bar always had the exact drink you wanted available. An unlimited supply of every alcoholic beverage in existence. It was, in short, a drunkard's paradise.When they entered the second door, they were greeted by a myriad of women all ready to satisfy every sexual desire they could possible have. There were multiple women of every shape, size and ethnicity imaginable. Looking closer you would notice that there were even celebrity and work crushes from your life in the crowd. Every single one of them ready  to please you. It was, in short, a pervert's paradiseFinally, when they entered the third door, they found themselves in a forest made of cannabis. The ground was made of kief, all the bushes wore beatiful buds and even the trees were 20 feet tall cannabis plants. There were every strain it has or ever will be possible to grow. You could even find rocks of hashish laying around the forest floor if you looked closely. It was, in short, a stoner's paradise.The Devil asked the men which room they each wanted. The words had barely left the Devil's mouth before the first man ran directly to the room with a myriad of women. The second man then went to the room with the bar, thinking that if he was going to spend 666 years in hell, he might as well be drunk for most of it. Lastly, the third man, thinking he had won the lottery, gladly went towards the room with the forest of cannabis.666 years later, the Devil returned to see if the men had atoned for their sins.When he opened the first door, bottles slowly rolled out and you could immediately smell piss and puke coming from the room. It took the Devil a while, but he finally found the man nestled between the bottles, smeared in his own shit and puke, and with arguably the worst hangover in history. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.When he opened the second door, he was overwhelmed with the sound of hundreds of crying children and angry women. Not ten seconds after the door opened, the man came running, pleading for the Devil to please let him out. There were kids of every age running around screaming and all the women were angry at each other, while everyone, children and mothers alike, were angry at the man. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.When the Devil opened the third door, he immediately saw the man sitting cross legged in a giant pool of his own tears. The Devil had not expected this. Confused, he went to ask the man what was wrong.	The man, tears still running down his face, looked up at the Devil and said:I don't have a lighter

A perfectly triangular lake has 3 kingdoms on its 3 sides. . The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.	And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

A businessman is getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knows his wife is always horny, so he decides to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn’t much like the idea of her screwing someone else. So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation, to the old man.Well, I don’t really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don’t know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except a... said the old man, and then he stopped.Except what? asked the businessman.Nothing, nothing, said the old man.C’mon, tell me! I need something! protested the businessman.Well, sir, I don’t usually mention this, but there is the ‘voodoo dildo,’ the old man said.The voodoo dildo? the businessman asked.The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!The old man said, But you haven’t seen what it’ll do yet.He pointed to a door and said Voodoo dildo, the door.The voodoo dildo rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, Voodoo dildo, box!The voodoo dildo stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, motionless.The businessman said, I’ll take it!The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, Voodoo dildo, my pussy.He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.After he’d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dildo. She lay down, placed the box between her legs, and said Voodoo dildo, my pussy! The voodoo dildo shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she’d ever experienced before.After three orgasms, she decided she’d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off! So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she’d had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn’t been drinking, but that a voodoo dildo was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn’t stop screwing her.The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, Yeah, right.	Voodoo dildo, my ass!

A priest told me this joke as a kid. There were 3 men, they were best friends, and they were quite unhealthy. Their names were, Bert, Chester, and Earl.They were actually really unhealthy and Bert decided that he needed to take charge of him and his friends' health. He decided that they were going to be on a diet together to help them live for as long as possible. He broke the news to his friends, and they weren't too happy about it, but they decided to go along with it anyways, because they knew how out-of-shape they all were. It was tough for them all to stick to the plan at times, however they got through it together. They each lost between 120-140 pounds over the course of 20 years and were in amazing shape for their age.One day the 3 of them were given great news.Bert got a call, he answered it, then turned around to everyone and said: Guys! My daughter just had a child! I'm going to be a grandpa!. Everybody was celebrating for Bert when Earl got a call from his son. He answered it, and turned around to everybody and said:Guys! My son is going to get married today! I'm so excited!. Everybody was now celebrating for Bert and Earl, when Chester got a call. He answered it, turned around and said to everybody: Guys! My family is having a reunion today! I'm going to see so many people that I haven't seen in years!.They found out that the wedding, hospital, and park where the reunion was were all in the same town, and decided to carpool together to get there. It had snowed a little the day before and the roads were a little icy. As they were getting onto the highway, their car slipped and ran into a semi-truck. It killed all three of them.The three of them wake up together in heaven. They notice an angel standing over them and one of them asks Where are we?. The angels says: Congratulations, you made it to heaven. The angel decides to show them around the place and starts at a banquet. Here is a banquet for you three to enjoy, you've earned it. Chester looks a little sad, and Earl notices and asks him, What's wrong?. Chester finally speaks up, Okay, this is so nice of you to put together, but we're on a diet. I wouldn't want to overdo my calorie intake for the day. The angle replies to them, No worries, you can have as much food as you like without worrying about it. The guys are elated by that news, when the angel decides to show them another place.Next, the angel decides to show them a place where they can spend time having fun. He shows them to a massive building with games everywhere you look. There are at least 50 pool tables, 30 bowling alley lanes, people are playing poker, there are arcade games everywhere, and tons of people enjoying themselves. He tells them,This is where you may spend much of your time, if you choose. Many people enjoy it here and you might find some new friends. The guys really like this room, but Earl notices that Chester is looking sad again. Earls asks him,What's wrong?. Chester responds with,My wife left me because of my gambling problems, I don't want to disappoint anyone else because of it. I'm afraid I wont be able to enjoy this area. The angel then slightly irritated lets him know,Don't you see? There are no problems here. You don't have to worry about gambling issues, because money isn't an issue here. Chester is especially happy to hear that news, and the angel decides to show them where they are going to live.The angel finally takes them to the third place, and it is a huge mansion. The guys are led inside, when the angel says, This is where you three can live, if you choose to. Otherwise we have some other mansions, if you want to live alone. The guys are very intrigued by the house, they notice a big window on a wall with an amazing view. They could see for at least 5 miles clearly. They all can't help but gasp when looking through the window. Earl can't help but be concerned about this place. He decides to ask, So, uh... What's the rent here?. The angel looks back at them with an irritated glare are replies Nothing? It's free. Earl is sure to thank the angel and says,Wow! That's so kind of you guys!. Bert notices that Chester is looking a little sad. Bert says,What's wrong Chester? Isn't it amazing here?. Chester looks up, looks Bert in the eye and says a little mad, If it weren't for your goddamn diet. Bert.	We could've been here 20 years ago!.

So, seeing some on sale, he bought them and wore them home.Walking proudly, he sauntered into the kitchen and said to his wife, notice anything different about me? Margaret, Age 75, looked him over. Nope. Frustrated, Robert stormed off into the bathroom, undressed and walked back into the kitchen completely naked except for the boots. Again he asked Margaret, a little louder this time, notice anything different now? Margaret looked up and said in her best deadpan, Robert, what's different? It's hanging down today, it was hanging down yesterday, it'll be hanging down again tomorrow. Furious, Robert yelled, and do you know why it's hanging down, Margaret? Nope. Not a clue, she replied. It's hanging down, because it's looking at my new boots!!!! Without missing a beat Margaret replied, should have bought a hat, Robert!	Should have bought a hat.

Man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.You're in the afterlife! he tells the man, But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.What are the odds? they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line. The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. Come, the beggar told him, I'll take you to the evening meal. So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line, and then he added, and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. What is it, he thought, that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here? That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.The beggar laughed jovially. I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in! Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. That's the line for the dragon meat, he said before turning to the next line, and that's the line for angeldust stew, then he paused, confused.What is it?	the man asked his old friend.The beggar replied, There appears to be no punchline.

A plane is spotted trying to land at Area 51. One day at Area 51 a radar tech spots a single engine plane on final approach to the secret Air Force base. The plane touches down and is immediately surrounded by armed guards. The plane is impounded and the pilot is whisked off for questioning. The pilot claims that he had been flying from Las Vegas, gotten lost, and nearly run out of fuel, so he put his plane down at the first runway he saw. After extensive background checks, it is proven that the pilot isn't a spy and he is set to be released the following morning.Before he is allowed to leave, he is given the You didn't see anything talk, and is told that under absolutely no circumstances is he allowed to tell anyone where he was, or what he saw. The Air Force fuels up the man's plane, gives him a proper heading to get back to Las Vegas, and sends him on his way. Later that day, the man's plane is again spotted getting ready to land at Area 51. This time there are two people in the plane. When the plane touches down, it is immediately surrounded by guards again.	As soon as it comes to a stop, the man hops out and yells: Do whatever you want to me, but SOMEBODY has to tell my wife where I was last night.
Donald Trump was visiting a primary school and he visited one of the classes. They were in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings. The teacher asked the President if he would like to lead the discussion on the word tragedy. So the illustrious leader asked the class for an example of a tragedy. One little boy stood up and offered: If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs over him and kills him, that would be a tragedy. No, said Trump, that would be an accident A little girl raised her hand: If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy. I’m afraid not, explained the president. That’s what we would call great loss. The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Trump searched the room. Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? Finally at the back of the room a small boy raised his hand... In a quiet voice he said: If ‘Air Force One’ was carrying you and was struck by a friendly fire missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy. Fantastic! exclaimed Trump. That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be tragedy?	Well, said the boy, It has to be a tragedy, because it certainly wouldn’t be a great loss, and it probably wouldn’t be a fucking accident either.

Three bulls heard the rancher was bringing another bull onto the ranch. First Bull: I've been here five years. I'm not giving this new bull any of my 100 cows.Second Bull: I've been here three years and have earned my right to 50 cows. I'm keeping all my cows.Third Bull: I've only been here a year, and so far, you guys have only let me have 10 cows. I may not be as big as you fellows, but I'm keeping all 10 of my cows.Just then an 18-wheeler pulls up in the pasture carrying the biggest bull they've ever seen. At 4,700 pounds, each step he takes strains the steel ramp.First Bull: I think I can spare a few cows for our new friend.Second Bull: I actually have too many cows to take care of. I can spare a few. I'm certainly not looking for an argument.They look over at the third bull and find him pawing the dirt, shaking his horns and snorting.First Bull: Son, don't be foolish -- let him have some of your cows and live to tell about it.Third Bull: Hell, he can have all my cows.	I'm just making sure he knows I'm a bull.

The year is 1804 and a young man enlists on a ship.. ..his first voyage is to last 3 years, and even though the work is hard the young man takes to it like a fish in water.After only a few days he is running the riggin like an old hand, he swabs the decks without complaint and spends his free time in amicable companionship playing cards or telling tall tales.All in all the young man feels as if he has found his calling.A few weeks go by like this, the young man loving his new life except one part.. There are no women.After a couple of months like this, he is starting to feel extremely uncomfortable with the situation and voices his complaints to his shipmates one evening.Why don't you just use the barrel? Asks one of his mates with a surprised look .It turns out that down in the hold, in a dark corner there is a barrel, with a hole drilled into the side.. Whenever the sailors start to feel their urges rise, they simply go down to the barrel and take care of their business there.The young man decides, with some scepticism, to try the barrel, and finds to his surprise that it is a wholly pleasant experience, in no way lesser than any he has had with real women before.With this new found release the young man starts to enjoy his work even more. His days continue as before, and his evenings are still spent in pleasant company, but a new addition to his routine is a nightly visit to the barrel.Another two months pass in this way and all is well, until one night as he gets up from his seat at the card table and announces that he is going to visit the barrel to his mates.A few chuckles greet this announcement and one of his friends asks Trying to get the final fun out of it eh?Final fun? Are we getting rid of the barrel?	The young man asks, worry playing over his face.Not at all mate, it's just that.. next month is your turn in the barrel.
do you think this is a good one.  A young boy enters a barber shop and the barber whispers to his customer. ‘This is the dumbest kid in the world. Watch while I prove it you.’ The barber puts a dollar bill in one hand and two quarters in the other, then calls the boy over and asks, ‘Which do you want, son?’ The boy takes the quarters and leaves. ‘What did I tell you?’ said the barber. ‘That kid never learns!’ Later, when the customer leaves, he sees the same young boy coming out of the ice cream store. ‘Hey, son! May I ask you a question?	Why did you take the quarters instead of the dollar bill?’ The boy licked his cone and replied, ‘Because the day I take the dollar, the game is over!’

And she noticed... What's wrong? Scarlett Johansson asked, Nothing... the guy would say...She pestered him for a while eventually saying she would do ANYTHING he needed or wanted to make him feel good again, just because she really cared for him a lot, and even if he wasn't asking, she felt it was the least she owed it to him...Really?, you'll do anything I'd like?yes she said anything!ok, first i want you to take off you toga and get into this pair of work jeans that somehow washed on the shoreok...now put this shirt on please, but first, tape your boobs so they are flatwha... ok, I'd say I'd do anything she said lovingly.ok, now, take this hat and wear it, but tuck your hair under itShe was kinda confused, but non the less, she wanted to make him happy, so she tucked her hair under the hat.Now id like for you to grab this piece of soot and paint yourself a beard and a mustacheok... if this is what you want... she muttered.now, please, put on these sunglasses, and start walking down the beach I'll catch up to you in a bit, he said a bit excited...She started walking... wondering... doubting herself... just confused about what had just happened, maybe it wasn't her, maybe it was h... suddenly the guy grabs her by her shoulder turns her around and says: DUDE!!!	you won't believe who I've been fucking for the past 6 months!

A Jewish man on the subway is reading an Arab newspaper. A friend of his, who happened to be riding in the same subway car, noticed this strange phenomenon. Very upset, he approached him. Moshe, have you lost your mind? Why are you reading an Arab newspaper? Moshe replied, I used to read the Jewish newspaper, but what did I find? Jews being persecuted, Israel being attacked, Jews disappearing through assimilation and intermarriage, Jews living in poverty. So I switched to the Arab newspaper. Now what do I find? Jews own all the banks, Jews control the media, Jews are all rich and powerful, Jews rule the world.	The news is so much better!
A guy was walking down the street when he sees a woman with perfect breasts. He says to her, Hey, miss, would you let me bite your breasts for $100? Are you nuts? she replies and walks away.He turns around, runs around the block and gets to the corner before she does. Would you let me bite your breasts for $1,000? he asks again. Listen, sir, I'm not that kind of woman. Got it?So the guy runs around the next block and faces her again. Would you let me bite your breasts... just once for $10,000? So the woman thinks about this for a while and says, Hmmmmm, $10,000? She thinks a bit OK, but just once, and not here. Let's go to that dark alley over there.So they go to the alley and she takes off... her blouse to reveal the most perfect breasts in the world. As soon as the guy sees them, he jumps on them and starts caressing them, fondling them, kissing them, burying his face in them... but not biting them. Finally, the woman gets all annoyed and says, Are you gonna bite them or what? Nah, he replies.	Costs too much!

I took my daughter out for her first drink... While reading an article about fathers and sons drinking together, I remembered the time I took my daughter out for her first drink. Off we went to our local bar only two blocks from the house. I got her a Guinness. She didn't like it, so I drank it. Then I got her a Killian's she didn't like that either, so I drank it. Finally, I thought she might like some Harp Lager? She didn't. I drank it. I thought maybe she'd like whiskey better than beer so we tried a Jameson's; nope! In desperation, I had her try that 25 year old Glenfiddich. The bar's finest scotch. She wouldn't even smell it. What could I do but drink it! By the time I realized she just didn't like to drink, I was so shit-faced I could hardly push her stroller back home!!!	~  ~  *[edit: Thank you for the gold, kind stranger.]

As a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: 5 lamb chops, please.  Amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop. He follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and trot across the road to a bus-stop. The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench. When a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus. The butcher follows, dumbstruck. As the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery. After awhile he stands on his back paws to push the stop bell, then the butcher follows him off. The dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step. He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door. He does this again and again. No answer. So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window, jumps off, and waits at the front door. A big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog. The butcher runs up and screams at the guy: What the hell are you doing? This dog's a genius! The owner responds, Genius, my ass.........	It's the second time this week he's forgotten his keys!

The farmer and his wife needed a new bull... There was a man who lived on a farm with his wife in the middle of nowhere. All they owned was a truck, a few cows, and an old bull. They didn't have much, but they were happy. One day, the farmer woke up and found that the bull had died. He went to his wife and said, I take our money into the town and buy us a new bull. I know you need the truck here to keep the farm running, so when I get us a bull, I'll send you a telegraph so you know when to pick us up.His wife went and got the money and then said goodbye.The farmer arrived in town late that day and had to get a hotel room. The next morning he only had 401 dollars left. He went to the market and was able to buy a strong, young bull with the 400 dollars. It had been a long time since he had been to town, but as long as the telegraph prices hadn't gone up, he should be able to send a full sentence to his wife with his dollar.When he arrived at the post office, he said to the telegraph operator: I need to send a message to my wife so she can pick up my bull and I. How much is a word?Prices went up a few years ago, replied the operator. A word is 1 dollar.Oh no, said the farmer I can only send one word! He thought for a little while and then said, Ok, send my wife the word 'comfortable.'Comfortable? Are you sure? asked the operator.My wife has a 4th grade education, the farmer replied. When she reads she has to sound each word out syllable by syllable.	So when she sees the word comfortable, she'll read it as 'come-for-ta-bull.'
