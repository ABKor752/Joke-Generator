When you come out, you may play with your train, but I want you to use nice language. Two hours later, the son comes out of the bedroom and resumes playing with his train. Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say, All passengers who are disembarking from the train, please remember to take all of your belongings with you.

So a horse wants to start a band... The horse needs some of his friend from the farm to help him out so they can become a band. First he needs a guitarist, and who better than his friend chicken who played guitar for 3 years. He asks chicken if he wants to join and he agrees. Next he needs a drummer, so horse thought about asking sheep who was a professional drummer for another band a long time ago. Sheep agrees and says he’ll play. Finally horse needed to find a bassist. This was difficult because no one he knew played the bass, but one of chicken friends, pig, played the bass so chicken asked his friend if he wanted to join. Pig said sure so pig came to the farm to meet the rest of the bandThey played a couple of gigs and got really good over the period of 6 months, so good in fact they were asked by a famous television talk show host if they wanted to come in and perform for the show. The band gladly agreed and got ready to go. The host was a couple of states away so they had to take a plane, and so the day came and they went on the plane early. Turned out the flight was overbooked and so horse said that he could wait for the next one since they were so early. Horse took the next flight a while later and landed after a couple hours. Horse got off of the plane to find people in terror looking at the broadcasted news show in the airport he landed in, so watching the tv he saw that the flight his friends were on had crashed and there were no survivors. The horse a day later was really depressed so he went to a bar to drink his problems away. When he walked in he sat at the counter and the bartender took a look at him, seeing he was sad.	Out of curiosity and wanting to see if he could help, the bartender approached the horse and asked, Why the long face?

Beans for lunch. During lunch at work, I ate 3 plates of beans (which I know I shouldn't). When I got home, my wife seemed excited to see me and exclaimed delightedly, Darling I have a surprise for dinner tonight. She then blindfolded me and led me to my chair at the dinner table. I took a seat and just as she was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. She made me promise not to touch the blindfold until she returned and went to answer the call. The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my wife was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a garbage dump! I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable! Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my wife returned, apologizing for taking so long. She asked me if I had peaked through the blindfold, and I assured her I had not.	At this point, she removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table, with their hands to their noses, chorused, Happy Birthday!

i had it all.  I talked with a homeless man this morning and asked him how he ended up this way. He said, Up until last week, I still had it all.

I had no bills and no debt. I even had full medical coverage. I felt sorry for him, so I asked, What happened? Drugs? Alcohol? Divorce? Oh no, nothing like that, he said. No, no....

A man took his date to a local country club. When they arrived, he told her to sit down and he would go fetch their food. Well, at this country club, there were different lines for everything. He went and stood in the pot roast line. Then the vegetable line, the bread line, the gravy line, and the salt and pepper line.Finally, he returned with two heaping plates of food. He then asked her what she would like to drink. Some fruit punch would be nice, she replied. So he went back. He walked all over the club for around an hour, with no luck. There was a wine line, a water line, and even a chocolate milk line. After having no luck, he returned to the table empty-handed.	There's no punch line.

A man decided he was going to ride his bike on the highway. He made it before the mountains just became too much and he couldn't bike and further. For three hours, he stuck his thumb out and no one stopped. Eventually, a dude in a Corvette pulled over and offered to give him a ride. However, the bike couldn't fit in the car. The owner of the Corvette found a piece of rope lying by the highway and tied one end to his bumper. He tied the other end to the bike and told the man that if he was going too fast, to simply honk the horn on his bike and that he would slow down.

Determined to make it with my God-given birth name, I refused. You told me I would never make it in Hollywood with a name like Penis van Lesbian. After I left your office, I thought about what you said. I decided you were right. I had to change my name but I had too much pride to return to your office, so I signed with another agent. I would never have made it without changing my name, so the enclosed check is a token of my appreciation.Thank you for your advice.	Sincerely, Dick van Dyke

[LONG] A few lumberjacks were realxing around a campfire after a long days work... They had cracked open a couple of beers and were telling stories of the biggest trees they've cleared, and how easily they fell after 9 or 10 swings of their axe.The biggest, burliest man speaks up after a few men had spoken and says, That's nothing. I can cut down trees twice the size of that in just 6 chops.From the other side of the fire, someone says, That's impressive alright. But, I can cut down trees of that size with just 2 swings of my axe.The lumberjacks pause for a second, and take a look at the man who said that: a tall and scrawny older man who didn't even look like he could swing an axe. They burst into laughter.The older man let them calm down before he began again. He said, Alright, if you don't believe me, lets put it to the test then. You pick the strongest man from your group and find 2 evenly sized trees. I guarantee I'll knock it down in less swings than him.The other lumberjacks, holding back their laughter now, look up and pick the biggest and strongest guy in their group. They find 2 large and evenly sized trees. The strongest man steps up to his tree and takes a swing. Then he takes 5 more well placed swings and the tree falls. He looks over at the old man and says, Ok, your turn.The old man steps up to his tree and, sure enough, in two swings of his axe, the tree falls.The other lumberjacks look at him with awe as they gather around the fire again. Finally, one of them breaks the silence with a gentle question. How'd you do it? You don't even look like you can swing an axe and yet you took down the biggest tree we could find with just 2 swings!The old man paused and looked around the group. Have you ever heard of the Sahara Forest? he asked.You mean the Sahara Desert?	asked one of the other lumberjacks.The old man looked back with a smile and said, so is that what they're calling it now?

I wish my head moved backwards and forwards forever. With a 'poof' his head begins to move backward and forward. He smiles with glee.The genie thanks the men, the men thank the genie and they all go on their separate ways.Years later, they decide to meet again at a restaurant. The first man arrives first in a designer suit, his stunning wife under his arm. The second arrives looking even more glamorous and the two talk.My life couldn't be better. The first says I invested the million I got and made even more money and invested that! Now I'm one of the richest men on earth, I haven't had a cold not even a runny nose for years and I'm married to the most beautiful woman who is also amazing in the sack. He laughs with joy.The second man chuckles Well I am the richest man on earth and I used that money to build charities, create companies, I feel happier that Im making a difference. I haven't aged a day, feel like I'm in my prime and I tell you, I think you're wife is pretty great in the sack too. He says with a wink. Finally, the third man shows up.

A lawyer's trick . . . A defendant was on trial for murder. There was strong evidence indicating guilt, but there was no corpse. In the defense’s closing statement the lawyer, knowing that his client would probably be convicted, resorted to a trick.Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I have a surprise for you all, the lawyer said as he looked at his watch.Within one minute, the person presumed dead in this case will walk into this courtroom. He looked toward the courtroom door. The jurors, somewhat stunned, all looked on eagerly. A minute passed. Nothing happened.Finally the lawyer said, Actually, I made up the previous statement. But you all looked on with anticipation. I therefore put to you that you have a reasonable doubt in this case as to whether anyone was killed and insist that you return a verdict of not guilty.The jury, clearly confused, retired to deliberate. A few minutes later, the jury returned and pronounced a verdict of guilty.But how? inquired the lawyer.	You must have had some doubt; I saw all of you stare at the door.The jury foreman replied: Oh, we did look, but your client didn’t.

Three men were standing in line to get into heaven one day.  Apparently it had been a pretty busy day, though, so Peter had to tell the first one, Heaven's getting pretty close to full today, and I've been asked to admit only people who have had particularly horrible deaths. So what's your story?So the first man replies: Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this naked man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell-but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died right then and there on the balcony.That sounds like a pretty bad day to me, said Peter, and let the man in. The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and one of my favorite hobbies is dancing around naked while eating pickles out of a glass jar. As I was doing so the other day, I slipped on an errant pickle and slipped over the balcony. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but thankfully I fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. I thought I was the luckiest guy in the world, but a refrigerator fell out of the sky and crushed me to death!Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death. The third man came to the front of the line, and again the whole process was repeated. Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story.	The man responds:I died naked inside a refrigerator.

Your duck is dead. A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest.After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.The distressed woman wailed, Are you sure?Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead, replied the vet..How can you be so sure? she protested.. I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.The vet looked at the woman and said, I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. $1,500! she cried,$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!The vet shrugged, I'm sorry.	If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500.

A Japanese man decides to do some travelling in Africa. A few days into his journey, he came across a tribe not far from a large and dense rain-forest. The tribe leader was ecstatic that someone of Asian descent was at his tribe. They quickly exchanged names and the tribe leader offered to give a quick tour of the rain-forest nearby.Sato was amazed at the wildlife diversity and learnt many new things about African flora and fauna. The tribe leader was happy that his guest was enjoying his time.About ten more minutes of walking, they encountered a cave; it was pitch black. Sato tried to make out any figures or objects in the cave but light only shone in about a few meters.Toot toot toot, the tribe leader called out in a deep and nonchalant voice.The tribe leader edged towards the cave and cup his hand around his ear, awaiting a response.Toot toot toot, a slightly higher pitched voice called back.The tribe leader quickly took off all his clothes and dashed into the cave, leaving Sato shocked and confused.About five minutes later, the tribe leader strolled out, sweating all over and panting in exhaustion.What in the world just happened?! Sato asked frantically.The tribe leader laughed as he slowly put on his clothes.We have a interesting culture here in this area; when you see a cave, you must call out like me and wait for a reply. If you hear reply, it mean that there are a beautiful woman inside wanting to have the sex and you must run in swiftly!Sato was taken aback; he has never heard anything like it!The next day, he trekked alone into the mountain side and came across a smaller rain-forest where wet leaves littered the ground from a storm that morning.The tribe leader's words echoed in his mind and his curiosity was at an all time high; would the same thing happened?The damp atmosphere was relaxing as he briskly explored the rain-forest, capturing the beautiful African nature around him.Lo and behold, right next to the mountains was an extremely huge cave that stood about two to three times his height.He was exhilarated! A cave this huge must mean many women who could be bustier or more sexually active. He put down his belongings and called out as loud as he could,Toot toot toot!He paused and listened.But there was no reply.Toot toot toot! !He called even louder.Again, silence.Sato was furious, he refused to be robbed of this golden opportunity. He took a gulp of water and braced for the loudest call of his life.TOOT TOOT TOOT!Almost immediately, the cave shrieked back in an extremely solemn voice that was twice as loud. **TOOT TOOT TOOT!	**Sato was on cloud nine, he tore through his clothes with utmost joy and sprinted into the cave.The next morning, on the front page of the African Daily,**MYSTERY SURROUNDS DEATH OF A NAKED ASIAN MAN ON NORTH-EAST RAILROAD**

Purple box. is kid is walking to school one day when a man jumps out of the bushes at him, yells PURPLE BOX! then dies. The kid – lets just call him The Kid from now on – was pretty shaken up by the experience. I mean its not every day a crazy old man yells you and dies, but not knowing what to do he continues on his way to school. When he gets there he tries to forget about it and goes about his business until recess comes.All the kids go out to play and do whatever it is little children do. (Susie was playing hopscotch, Steven was on the swings, ect) That's when the kid told his friend Jimmy about the the old man. Hey Jimmy, today i was walking to school when an old man walked up to me and yelled Purple Box then- as soon as he heard Purple Box Jimmy froze, his face turned to horror and he ran off, leaving no explanation and a very confused Kid. A few minutes the bell rang and The Kid goes back to class where hes stopped by his teacher. Jimmy said you told him a naughty story at recess today, is this true? The Kid had no idea what she meant by naughty story so he tried to explain it, but as soon as he got to the end of the story the teacher look down at him with the most appalled look you ever seen and said Young man, i have never heard such rude language in my life! Go to the office right now!So hes in the office and the principal says to him Son I've been told you've been sent down to my office because of a story? The Kid looks at him a little scared and tells him the story Well today I was walking to school when a man walked up to me and said Purple Box, then he died. I told Jimmy and he freaked out. I told the teacher and she sent me here. whats the big deal with the purple box? The principal looked down at him with a look of disgust. Young man you are going home right now! you are expelled from this school and the kid goes home.When he gets there his mother asks him why he home and he tells her about the Purple Box. She looks down on him says how dare you use that kind of language in front of your mother! Go to your room right now! A few hours later his dad walks into his room and and asks what wrong, The kid tells him, Today a man walked up to me said Purple Box then died. I told Jimmy, and he freaked out. I told my teacher, and she sent me to the office. I told the office and they sent me home. I told mom and she sent me to my room. His dad gets up leaves the room and doesn't come back for several hours. When he does come back he has a briefcase with him and he says, Son this briefcase has 10,000 dollars in it. I want you to take it and never come back to this house again So The Kid is crushed, they packs his bags, they buy him a plane ticket to china, and they send him on his way.On the plane one of the stewardesses called him over to come see the cockpit. (One of those hey lets make some random kids day things you see on tv and shit.) So he goes up, they show him some buttons and flashy bits, and eventually the reason for why hes on the plane in the first place comes up, so The Kid tells them about the old man and the Purple box. The pilot, after hearing the story says, There's a parachute in the back of the fuselage. I want you to take it and get the hell off my plane. They escort him to the back of the plane, strap him in, and toss him out 10,000 feet over the Atlantic ocean.The kid opens his parachute just fine – evidently there is such a thing as natural talent when it comes to jumping out of an airplane – and floats down to an island where he meets an old castaway. They talk for a while – make friends even – and then he tells him about the old man. Well, I was walking to school when an old man jumped out at me and yelled Purple Box. I told my friend Jimmy and he freaked out. I told my teacher and she sent me to the office. I told the office and they sent me home. I told my parents and they sent me on a plane. I told the pilot and he kicked off the plan. Please, please tell me. Whats a Purple Box?Now the old man sat there for a while, looking all deep and thoughtful. Then he turned to The kid and said, Theres a raft on the other side of the island. I spent 6 years making it, but I want you to take it and sail west to New York. There, you will find a Purple Box.So the kid sets off on an epic adventure across the Atlantic ocean. He fights pirates, wrestles sharks, punches C'thulu in the face, That sort on thing. Until eventually he makes it to New York. The Kid doesn't know where to start so he goes to the top of the empire state building to get a better view. When he peers over the edge of the building he sees a big, bright, sign that says Purple Box Here.	Now The Kid is so exited he completely ignores the elevator, bolts down the stairs, runs across the street, and gets hit by a bus.Moral of the story: Look both ways before crossing.Tl;Dr: What a twist!

The Russian pretzel. Three Americans were up against a very large Russian in a wrestling meet.

I'm scared.The coach replied, You da MAN! Just go in there and tear him up!The guy started the match quite confidently, but after about a minute, the Russian picked him up, slammed him into the famous pretzel, and sent him to the emergency room.The same thing happened to the second wrestler, so the third guy was petrified. He told his coach he was backing out.The coach said, C'mon, son. You're our last chance!The kid started out pretty well, but when the Russian started to twist him into the pretzel, the coach covered his eyes. When he opened them, he saw the referee holding the American's hand up in victory. The coach, baffled, asked the kid how he did it.Well Coach, when that damn Russian picked me up and started twisting my body, it HURT! So when I saw two red things dangling there, I bit them... HARD!

An elder in the tribe tells a teenage member to prove his worth... The elder says to Flying Arrow, to prove your worth, you must carve a totem that impresses the Chief, and you must do so with just this sharpened rock  The boy accepts the challenge and begins punching out chunks of bark and then flesh from the wood. He soon realizes that he has no vision, as he has never done this before. So he visits totems from the past that have pleased the Chiefs. He sees a simple one and thinks, I can’t go wrong with this, after all, no one has seen it lately. He uses the ancient totem as a guide to carving his own. The end result ends up looking far better than the model and he cannot wait to go before the Chief and show him his creation. The viewing ceremony begins. The elder tells the boy, you must kneel before the Chief while he inspects your totem. If he likes it, you must stand up and he will bestow you with a silver necklace which he will place around your neck. If he is not impressed, you must lie face down with your head in the dirt until every guest has walked away. The boy kneels before the Chief as the Chief makes a careful inspection of the totem. Then the Chief stands before the boy and places his hand on the boy’s shoulder. In a stern authoritative voice the Chief says, You get down Arrow.

She never said much. 	I looked at her, on one cold autumn day in Georgia.Her hair was like fresh straw straight off a barn’s floor.Her eyes were like pearls gazing into the great beyond.Being the lucky man I was, I looked at those beautiful eyes, and talked to her everyday, and oft bring her flowers to make her feel good inside.And o, she’d look me right in the eye as I spoke.But she never said much.I knew she had a love for me though, and I could always return that love.I kept coming to her place for days upon days, and sometimes we even laid upon her bed together.But she never moaned when we had pleasure.She never said much at all.One day, the cops came and busted me for something I swear I didn’t do.But alas, I knew even 6 months away couldn’t keep us apart for long.And so time passed, day after day, week after week, month after month... until one day.Eventually, after all the paperwork was sorted out in court, I finally got out of court.But then I went back to court for an announcement I’d made plans for.I’d marry that girl.I loved her, and she loved me.Our parents supported us no matter what.And so the law twisted around me once again.And hence we both laid back on our earthen beds together once more, but this time for life.We were meant to be together; whether it meant serving time for fucking my sister’s corpse or not, because we were a happy family either way.

FUCKING HELL SHERLOCK!? He looked down at me apologetically and dropped to the floor as if just realising his slackness and then... Fished out another fag       Oh... Sorry, Sir.

A traveling cowboy walks into a saloon. to rest and get a drink before continuing on his journey. As he sat down at one end of the bar the bartender walks over to him and asks what he would like to drink.Beer says the traveling cowboy.Right away says the bartender as he makes his way to the tap.As the cowboy watched the bartender fill a clean mug with a crisp lager he noticed a strange shape out of the corner of his eye. He turned his gaze towards it and his eyes widened in surprise as he realized what he was looking at. At the far end of the bar seated in stool sat a full sized horse whose eyes were filled with tears. A large jar filled with an assortment of coins and Bill's sat on the bar next to the horse. Though he was a traveling man and had seen many things over many years this was without a doubt the strangest sight the traveling cowboy had ever seen.The bartender shortly returned with our cowboy's drink and as he sat it on the bench in front of him  the cowboy spoke and asked,Why is there a full grown horse sitting on that there stool? And why is he crying?Well sir says the Bartender about one year ago this horse walked into this saloon with tears in his eyes, sat down in that very spot and ordered himself a drink. Hasn't moved or done nothin' else since. No one knows why he came in here or where he came from but one thing is for certain. Whatever horrors he witnessed to put him in such a state I would not like to know myself, nor would any man I reckon.Well I'll be says the Cowboy. What's that there jar for?A few months after he came some of my regular customers started making bets. Who ever can make that horse to do anything other than sit there and mourn takes the jar and all the money in it.Upon hearing this the Cowboy shook his head, drained his mug in one gulp, wiped his lips, stood up and walked over to the horse. The bartender watched in surprise as the cowboy sat down next to the horse and whispered in the horses ear. The tears in the horses eyes remained but no longer were they tears of sorrow. The horse erupted in a violent fit of laughter so loud in could be heard from the street outside the saloon. The cowboy, satisfied with his work stood up, grabbed the jar of money, tipped his hat to the bartender (who at this point was in a state of utter disbelief) and walked out the door.A year later the same traveling cowboy walked into the same saloon and sat down in the same spot he had the year prior. As he sat down he turned his gaze to the far side of the bar and quite to his surprise the horse was still there. Another jar had replaced the one he had taken, and the horse was still possessed by a state of violent laughter. YOU! Yelled the bartender who had just turned and recognized the face of the traveling cowboy. You think you can come back into my saloon after what you've done? That horse has not stopped laughing since the day you came in here and made him do so! It's been so disruptive I can't get anyone to come in here besides my regulars, and all they do is bet on that damned horse. Who ever can get him to do anything other than THAT takes the jar and all of its contents.Well I'll be. Says the cowboy as he stood up and slowly walked over to the horse.The bartender watched as the cowboy made his way to the far side of the bar. He watched the cowboy stand in front of the horse with his back facing the bartender. The bartender watched in an almost euphoric state of shock as the horse's laughter stopped. As the cowboy stood there, the horses countenance fell to the same state it was one year prior. Tears welled up in his eyes and he began to weep once again.Satisfied with his work the cowboy grabbed the new jar and again tipped his hat to the bartender as he made his way to the door.Wait just a goddamn minute! The bartender screamed.I beg your pardon? The cowboy replied as he turned and began walking back toward the bar.Well hell. You come in here one year ago and you say somthing to that horse, which mind you, had not done nothin' but cry and mourn for one year prior to your arrival. Something so goddamn funny that he then cannot do anything but laugh and be disruptive for the next year, driving away all my customers. Then you come in here now and just stand there and he stops!? You put me through all that and you're just gonna walk out of this saloon without so much as a goodbye? Well that don't sit right with me. So I demand that you tell me what you did to that horse to make his laugh and then cry like that.I guess I do owe you that bartender. Says the travelling Cowboy. Well a year ago when I came In here and that horse was crying I went up to him and I told him as that my dick was bigger than his. What in the hell are you talking about? Says the bartender in a very sarcastic tone. You expect me to believe that? Well mr. Big dick cowboy, what did you tell him today to get him to stop?I didn't tell him nothin' says the cowboy as a grin as big as Texas spread across his face.	Today I showed him.

A spy, an artist, and a basketball player are chewing the fat on the beach. It was a lovely day so the three friends got together to enjoy each other's company and engage in stimulating discussions about various topics. The spy was initially hesitant to rendezvous at the beach, as she preferred more secluded settings where she had a chance to blend in with the crowd. On the beach, this was not possible, as she possessed an unrivaled figure that would be sure to attract attention from horny onlookers. But the spy recognized the futility of her efforts to persuade her stubborn friends so she ultimately decided to dress as modestly as possible in hopes of deflecting unwelcome eyes. It didn't work. She was the only person within a five-mile radius who came overdressed for the occasion. The artist noticed that there were a group of teenagers playing volleyball nearby and went over to ask them if he could join. The basketball player was puzzled by his friend's initiative, as everyone considered the artist something of a recluse. Perhaps the sun worked in mysterious ways and inspired in the artist what little social sensibility he could muster. The spy didn't think much of the gesture and turned her attention to the basketball player. Why don't you go join them? She asked. After all, you're a professional athlete. You know why responded the basketball player. I most certainly do not replied the spy. In that case, I'm not going to tell you. The day was growing old and the three friends said their goodbyes before retreating to their abodes. The spy reclined on her love seat and had a glass of wine while putting on her favorite record. The artist sat in his attic and painted a scene inspired by the day's events on the beach. He would take intermittent breaks to meditate and reflect. By the time he was finished with his painting, it was so marvelous and captured the authentic feeling of his experience on the beach so accurately that it was almost too beautiful to bear. He was impressed by his ability to directly translate his complicated emotions to the canvas and vowed to never grow complacent or satisfied with his progress for fear of resigning himself to idleness. Across town, the basketball player reached her home. That's the joke, the basketball player is a woman.	You don't have to like it.

A sucessful business man retires. A successful business man in NYC finally decided to retire. After years of making it big in the stock market, years of wild parties, and years of living the city life, he packs up and moves to rural Montana. He's sick of the busy city, so he picks a very remote house in a very secluded rural area. His closest neighbor is 3 miles away, and his mail/groceries are delivered once a week. He never has to see anyone again.He spends his time reading books, enjoying the nature, and in general enjoying his time alone. One day his doorbell rings, and he opens his door to a large, rough looking man. The man let's him know that his name is Lars, and he's his neighbor from about 5-6 miles up the road. He's having a party on Saturday, and the man is invited. This sounds great! the man thinks to himself. I've been here alone these past few months, and I'm starting to get a little lonely. Meeting the rest of the neighbors sounds like a pretty good time.He says yes, and Lars is very happy to hear so. Before he goes, Lars gives him a warning: Just so you know, there's probably going to be some poker or other card games. I don't know how you feel about gambling, but some folks around here aren't too keen on it. The man, having gone to a weekly guys poker night in his life in NYC, says he's totally fine with it. Lars speaks up again: Also, there's probably going to be some drinking. Lots of drinking. I don't know how you feel about alcohol, but some folks around here aren't too keen on it. The man hasn't been drunk much since he left NYC, thinks it'll be a great change of pace, and says that sounds good!Lars speaks up one last time: There's a good chance there's going to be a lot of sex. These parties can get a little out of hand. I don't know how you feel about orgies, but some folks around here aren't too keen on it. After his wild life in NYC, the man is no stranger to wild sexual experiences, and after several months of no sex, he agrees.Lars seems pleased, and turns to leave.The man stops him and asks: Wait, you forgot to tell me what time on Saturday.Lars replies: You can swing by anytime you want.	It's just going to be the two of us.
Sunday school. Little April was not the best student in Sunday school. Usually she slept through the class. One day the teacher called on her while she was napping, Tell me, April, who created the universe? When April didn't stir, little Johnny, a boy seated in the chair behind her, took a pin and jabbed her in the rear. GOD ALMIGHTY! shouted April and the teacher said, Very good and April fell back asleep. A while later the teacher asked April, Who is our Lord and Saviour, But, April didn't even stir from her slumber. Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again. JESUS CHRIST! shouted April and the teacher said, very good, and April fell back to sleep. Then the teacher asked April a third question. What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child? And again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin. This time April jumped up and shouted, IF YOU STICK THAT F*****G THING IN ME ONE MORE TIME, I'LL BREAK IT IN HALF AND STICK IT UP YOUR ARSE!	The Teacher fainted

So there's this musician..... So theres this musician who is incredibly gifted. Any instrument he touches he can instantly play at a masters level. Unfortunately for the musician he lived in a country ruled by a dictator. One day the dictator learns of the musician's talent and has the musician brought before him.The dictator gives the musician a task: compose and conduct a symphony to be played at the next political rally. Having no choice the musician agrees. He toils day and night for the next month, feverishly trying to create the perfect composition. When the day of the rally comes the musician confidently strides on stage, bows to the dictator, *tap tap taps* his baton on the music stand, and begins conducting. And the most godawful sound comes from the orchestra. Like nails on a chalkboard bad. The dictator is furious. He orders the musician to be executed the next day. After he's thrown in jail for the night, the musician asks if he can have a last meal. After deliberating the guards decide it wouldn't hurt anything. The musician orders the hottest curry the guards could find. As hot as it could possibly be. And he eats all of it right down to the last bit.The next morning comes and the guards haul the musician out of his cell, drag him to the execution chamber, and strap him into the electric chair. As they throw the switch the lights begin to flicker, smoke starts billowing, and there's a massive *POP*. The guards quickly turn off the power and start peering through the dissipating smoke. Much to their surprise the musician is sitting there unharmed. They quickly get the dictator on the phone and explain that the musician is still alive. The dictator decides to see the miracle musician for himself. Once the dictator arrives he sees the musician, who seems to be in a jovial mood. Enraged the dictator throws the electric chair switch again. Once again the lights begin to flicker, smoke starts billowing, and there's a massive *POP*. The dictator slowly turns off the power and allows the smoke to clear. Sure enough the musician is unscathed. How?! How are you still alive?! the dictator yells.The musician contemplates his answer for a moment and replies, Well, you see, I am an incredible musician. But sir......	I'm a terrible conductor.

The Vaseline Biker. A young man has always dreamed on owning a Harley Davidson. One day he has finally saved up enough money so he goes down to the dealer. After picking out the perfect bike the dealer warns him that if he leaves his Harley in the rain the chrome has a tendency to rust. He tells the young man an old biker's trick is to keep a jar of Vaseline handy and smear it on the chrome if the bike must be left out in the rain.A few months later the young man meets a woman and falls in love. She asks him to come home and meet her parents over dinner. He readily agrees and the date is set. At the appointed time he picks her up on his Harley and they ride to her parents house. Before they go in she tells him that they have a family tradition that whoever speaks first after dinner must do the dishes.After a delicious dinner everyone sits in silence waiting for the first person to break and get stuck doing the dishes. After a long fifteen minutes the young man decides to speed things up so he reaches over and kisses thewoman in front of her family.And no one says a word...! Next he decides to take a more direct approach so he throws her on the table and has sex with her in front of everyone. And still no one says a word...!!! Now he is getting desperate, so he grabs her mother and throws her on the table. They have even wilder sex. But no one says a word...!!! !By now he is getting very worried and is wondering what to do next when he hears thunder in the distance.

I’ve searched the archives of Reddit and haven’t seen it posted before so here goes:Little Johnny’s parents were having problems with him swearing and couldn’t get him to stop, so his dad goes to a psychiatrist and tells him the issue. The psychiatrist says as you know, Christmas is coming up so what I want you to do is tuck little Johnny into bed on Christmas Eve and ask him what he wants for Christmas. Every time he swears, replace that gift with a pile of dog shit. He dad replies well that seems strange, but I’m out of options so I’ll give it a shot. So Christmas Eve creeps up and little Johnny’s dad is tucking him into bed. He asks little Johnny, What do you want for Christmas this year?Little Johnny replies  When I wake up Christmas morning I wanna see a god damn teddy bear laying right next fucking next to me on this pillow. When I go downstairs, I wanna see a fucking choo choo train wrapped around the god damn Christmas tree, and when I go outside I wanna see a big fucking red bike in my god damn garage.His dad says Ok little Johnny. See you Christmas morning.Christmas morning comes and little Johnny wakes up and rolls over in bed. He sees a pile of dog shit. What the fuck? He goes down stairs and sees dog shit all over around the Christmas tree. He screams What the fuck is this!? He goes outside and sees a big pile of dog shit sitting in the garage.	He is sitting there cursing up a storm and his dad walks out as asks, So little Johnny, what did you get for Christmas this year?Little Johnny says I think I got a fucking puppy but I can’t find that son of a bitch!

lucky mailman. after 20 years on the job the local postman is about to retire and on this last scheduled delivery run he finds himself beset with thankful friends and neighbours, all of whom show their appreciation of his years of service. loaded down with gift baskets, wine, flowers and thank you cards he reaches the last house on the run, owned by an incredibly buxom and attractive blonde, who was always friendly enough, and her very wealthy husband, whom the postman was sure never really liked him. as he pulls up he notices that the husbands car is already gone and this brightens the postman's mood a little as he knows he won't need to deal with the mans snide comments. ringing the doorbell and awaiting the wife's response the postman is nearly struck down with shock as the woman opens the door wearing nothing but a smile and, grabbing the postman by the tie, pulls him into the house, leads him up to her bedroom, and proceeds to fuck his brains out for the next half hour. still in a state of confusion but exceptionally pleased with how the last day of his carrier has gone, he is lead by the still naked woman to the kitchen where he is presented with a crisp, new $1 note and told to take a seat at the table. after a few minutes the woman, still displaying her ample assets serves the postman a full breakfast and asks what he'd like to drink, needing something to calm his nerves a little he asks for a scotch, one is poured and at last the woman puts on a dressing gown and sits down to breakfast with the postman. having finished off half the whisky he was poured the postman summons up enough courage to try and put his confusion to rest. trying very hard to keep his eyes on the wife's face and off her cleavage he says  Ma'am please do not think I am in anyway ungrateful for what you have just done for me, this has been far and away the best retirement present I've received today but I have to ask, why? you're a married woman , and beyond that you are married to a man who really doesn't like me and would, I'm sure, be very upset at the level of err,... *hospitality*, you've just shown me. and after all I am a simple postman. what did I do deserve the pleasures you've just given me? The woman smiles sweetly and replies 'well when I found out you were retiring I felt we should do something special for you to mark the occasion,  I brought this idea up to my husband and asked what we should do to thank you, he said 'fuck the postman!	give him a dollar' after a moments pause she adds 'the breakfast was my idea

A Man is walking down the street when he finds a Catholic Church. A man is walking along the street one day when he comes across a Catholic church on the side of road. As he walks by, he hears the most beautiful, gorgeous, blissful music coming from the inside of the church. Curious, and eager to find out what the source of such a magical noise could be, he opens the great wooden door and rushes in to find a humble, old priest bent over the alter, praying, while the music continues on in the background. Rushing over to the priest the man says My dear sir! What is that beautiful music I hear echoing through this gorgeous church? What is the source of such a wonderful sound? The old Catholic priest smiles and turns to the man, his old bones having slowed him down in his old age. Looking up at the man with bemusement, I wish I could tell you. he croaks. Slightly frustrated, the man pulls at his hair, desperate to know the source of the music. Well then why can't you tell me? The priest laughs again. If you want to know, you must become a Catholic priest for at least 20 years, as I did, many years ago, before I tell you of the source of this noise. Only a Catholic priest can see the source of the noise. The man quickly thanks the old priest, and with increased vigor, and an unquenchable thirst to find out what the source of the noise is, decides he will become a Catholic priest for 20 years to find out what the source is. Interestingly enough, not many people were applying to become Catholic priests at the time, didn't seem to be quite a popular job, but the man persevered, and became a Catholic priest. The job was demanding, and he wasn't particularly good at it, but come 20 years, the man, now old and feeling about as frail as the priest he had met 20 years ago, makes his way to that Catholic church he stumbled upon two decades ago, ready to discover the source of the noise. The man opens the great wooden door of the church and finds the same old priest bent over the alter. The aged priest looks so old he could practically whither to dust before the mans eyes. Eager that the past 20 years had finally come to its culmination, the man rushes up to the old priest and proudly declares his accomplishment. I've done it! he says proudly. I did what you said, and I've been a Catholic priest these past long 20 years. Will you show me the source of this gorgeous, this lovely music now? Slowly moving his head to look up at the man, as if afraid to injure himself, the kindly old priest nods. You have done well, and come at the proper time too. I feel as though my time here on this earth is up, and it is now time for you to know what the source of this music is, and for you to now watch over the source of the  he grabs at the mans arms. Pull me up, for I am an old man now, and my legs are weary. The two of them hobble to the old priests office, tucked away across the chapel. The old Catholic priest unlocks the door to his office, and opens up a drawer in his desk, before pulling out a rusty, old fashioned key. The man and the priest slowly make their way across the chapel to an ancient, plain looking wooden door. The priest unlocks the door to reveal a dark flight of wooden stairs that lead down. The duo make their way down the stairs, and walk down a deep dank, dimly lit passageway. They walk for about a solid 20 minutes before they reach a solid looking, but plain, iron door. The music is louder than it was before, and the man figures the source has to be just behind the solid, but plain, iron door. He tries the handle, but its locked. The old priest lets out a laugh. Darn it! I've forgotten the key to the door, its in my office. The man chuckles, although a little annoyed. It can happen to the best of us. The two of them leave the iron door, walk down the long dank passageway, up the flight of old wooden stairs, and through the wooden door, across the chapel, and into the priests office. The old priest opens a different drawer this time, and grabs a different, iron key. They then make their way across the chapel, through the wooden door, down the flight of old wooden stairs, walk down the long dank passageway, and back to the plain iron door. The old priest unlocks the plain iron door, and the two of them make their slow passage down a long, but steeply declining hallway until the two of them come across an ominous pristine stainless steel door, looming ahead of them. The music is even louder then it was before. The old priest moves to unlock the door, when he stops and smacks his forehead. Darn it! I've forgotten the key to the door. It's in my office. The man grimaces, but masks the rest of his frustration as the two of them leave the ominous stainless steel door, up the declining hallway, through the iron door, walk down the long dank passageway, up the flight of old wooden stairs, and through the wooden door, across the chapel, and into the priests office. The old priest opens a different drawer this time, and grabs a different, steel key. They then make their way across the chapel, through the wooden door, down the flight of old wooden stairs, walk down the long dank passageway, through the iron door, down the declining hallway, and back to the ominous stainless steel door. The old priest fumbles with the key for a bit before he unlocks the stainless steel door, and the two of them continue down a rustic, stone hallway. They walk for a while before the man notices the noise is even louder than before, and the two of them come across a polished bronze door. The old priest moves to unlockd the door, when he stops and smacks his forehad. Darn it! I've forgotten the key to the door. It's in my office. His temper building, the man grudgingly follows the old priest away from the polished bronze door, back down the rustic stone hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, up the declining hallway, through the iron door, walk down the long dank passageway, up the flight of old wooden stairs, and through the wooden door, across the chapel, and into the priests office. The old priest opens a different drawer this time, and grabs a different, bronze key. They then make their way across the chapel, through the wooden door, down the flight of old wooden stairs, walk down the long dank passageway, through the iron door, down the declining hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, down the rustic stone hallway, and back to the polished bronze door. The old priest fumbles with the key for a bit before he unlocks the polished bronze door. The man and the old priest make their way down a sleek metallic hallway, and the man notices that the gorgeous, beautiful music is even louder then it was at the bronze door. They continue walking till they reach a splendid silver door, its craftsmanship exceedingly fine, the music louder than ever. The old priest pauses before opening this door. Forgive me, he says, bending over. I am an old man, and my body is not what it used to be. The man shrugs. Who was he, to judge this elder for weariness? They wait for a moment before the old priest moves to unlock the splendid silver door, when he sotp and smacks his forehead. Don't tell me- the man starts, when the old priest cries Darn it! I've forgotten the key to the door. It's in my office. His temper building, but still longing to know what the source of the music is, the old priest and the man leave the splendid silver door, go back down the sleek metallic hallway, through the polished bronze door, back down the rustic stone hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, up the declining hallway, through the iron door, walk down the long dank passageway, up the flight of old wooden stairs, and through the wooden door, across the chapel, and into the priests office. The old priest opens a different drawer this time, and grabs a different, silver key. They then make their way across the chapel, through the wooden door, down the flight of old wooden stairs, walk down the long dank passageway, through the iron door, down the declining hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, down the rustic stone hallway, through the polished bronze door, down the sleek, metallic hallway, and back to the splendid silver door. The old man fumbles with his key for a bit before he unlocks the door, and the two of them go down a flight of polished obsidian stairs, till they reach a gorgeous, gem encrusted golden door, the music now the loudest it had ever been, practially deafining, but all the more beautiful and gorgeous. The man falls to his knees at the gem encrusted golden door, he could spend an eternity here, and still not fully appreciate its beauty. Don't worry. the priest says. This is the final door to the source of the music. The man is grateful, his quest if finally at its end, the wait finally over. The old priest moves to unlock the door, before smacking his head. Darn it! I've forgotten the key to the door. It's in my office. The man can forgive the old priest for his awful, awful memory at this point. It's the last door after all, and he can stand just one more trip with the old priest to his office. The two of them leave the gem encrusted, golden door, back up the polished obsidian stairs, go through the splendid silver door, go back down the sleek metallic hallway, through the polished bronze door, back down the rustic stone hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, up the declining hallway, through the iron door, walk down the long dank passageway, up the flight of old wooden stairs, and through the wooden door, across the chapel, and into the priests office. The old priest opens a different drawer this time, and grabs a different, golden key. They then make their way across the chapel, through the wooden door, down the flight of old wooden stairs, walk down the long dank passageway, through the iron door, down the declining hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, down the rustic stone hallway, through the polished bronze door, down the sleek, metallic hallway, through the splendid silver door, down the polished obsidian stairs, and back to the gorgeous, gem encrusted golden door. The old priest and the man reach the door, before the old priest stumbles, grabbing at the mans arm. My boy, he says, practically grasping for breath. My boy, he repeats my time here on this earth is now coming to a close. He clutches at his chest. The man urgently makes a move to move the old priest up so he can carry him to a hospital. The old priest however, stops him. No my boy, I wish to die here, next to this golden door I have long cherished, listening to this music that I have long protected. He slides down, laying against the wall adjacent to the golden door. I entrust you now, with both the protection of this church, and this music. Can you do that for me, my boy? Tears streaming down the mans eyes, he clasps  the old priests hands, taking the golden key. I will he stutters. I will. And before the mans eyes, the old priest dies, at peace. The man now solemnly turns to the gorgeous golden door, and unlocks it, the gorgeous music now playing as crystal clear as ever, the source of the music shown to him at last, inside revealing a vast open room, and in the center of it sits—I'm sorry, I can't tell you.

Far away in the tropical waters of the Caribbean, two prawns were swimming around in the sea - one called Justin and the other called Christian. The prawns were constantly being harassed and threatened by sharks that inhabited the area. Finally one day Justin said to Christian, 'I'm fed up with being a prawn; I wish I was a shark, and then I wouldn't have any worries about being eaten.' A large mysterious cod appeared and said, 'Your wish is granted', and lo and behold, Justin turned into a shark. Horrified, Christian immediately swam away, afraid of being eaten by his old mate. Time passed and Justin found life as a shark boring and lonely. All his old mates simply swam away whenever he came close to them. Justin didn't realise that his new menacing appearance was the cause of his sad plight. While swimming alone one day he saw the cod again and he thought that perhaps he fish could change him back into a prawn. He approached the cod and begged to be changed back, and, lo and behold, he found himself turned back into a prawn. With tears of joy in his tiny little eyes Justin swam back to his friends and bought them all a cocktail. Looking around the gathering at the reef he realised he couldn't see his old pal.' Where's Christian?' he asked.' He's at home, still distraught that his best friend changed sides to the enemy and became a shark', came the reply.

Christian replied, 'No way man, you'll eat me. you're now a shark, the enemy and I'll not be tricked into being your dinner.' Justin cried back ' No, I'm not. That was the old me. I've changed.' ...............  'I've found Cod.	I'm a prawn again Christian'

You're Not a Monk. A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk. The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.The man says, All right, all right. I’m \*dying\* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door. The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, Real funny. May I have the key? The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door. So, the monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire. So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.The man is relieved to no end.	He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.

Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam. His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. What happened? he asked, exasperated.The old monk shook his head sadly. Isn't it obvious? he said.	Sam sung Note 7.

Then he saw an envelope, propped up prominently on the pillow that was addressed to 'Dad. 'Fearing the worst, he opened the envelope with trembling hands and read the letter. It said:*Dear Dad,**It is with great regret and sadness that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you. **I have been finding real passion with Susie and she is so nice. But I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing, tattoos, tight motorcycle clothes and the fact that she is much older than I am. **But it's not only the passion. Dad she's pregnant. * *Don't worry though, Susie said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children. **Susie has also opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people that live nearby for cocaine and ecstasy. **In the meantime, we will pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Susie can get better. She deserves it. **Don't worry Dad. I'm 15 and I know how to take care of myself. **Someday I'm sure that we will be back to visit so that you can get to know your grandchildren. **Love, Your son Tim.**P.S. Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Jimmy's house. **I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than a lousy report card ...**That's in my desk drawer. **I love you.	*

I was the world's best archer. , when a woman came to my doorstep and asked me to teach her archery. I tried to turn her down, but she practically begged. What could I do? I had no choice but to accept.I taught her everything: how to hold the bow, the correct way to pull the arrow, how to aim and everything. She was a quick learner.A few weeks in, she could hit the stationary targets surprisingly well, so I decided to step it up a notch earlier than expected:We're going to move on to moving targets. Now, the key thing to remember with moving targets is that as soon as you see the target in your aim, you have to shoot immediately. Don't contemplate, don't even think about it - as soon as you see it, you shoot!She was a natural! After just a couple of hours she could hit them just as well as - no, *better than the stationary targets! She was outstanding. I found myself starting to fall in love with her.The next week, I took her to the woods where to have her practice on wild animals as living targets. Just as expected, she picked it up almost instantly. It seemed like every single shot she took always hit her target. Honestly, at this point I think she ever surpassed my abilities! At this point, there was no doubt in my mind. I was madly in love with her!That night I asked her out on a date. She said to me:If you had asked me that when I first met you, I would say yes in a heartbeat! But after all this time, after all you've taught me... I can't see you as anything more, or anything less than my teacher. I'm sorry... I guess you should have shot your target as soon as you saw it, huh?And that's when I realized...	I've trained that miss.

A British Officer at a Frontier Post. In 1869, a young British officer, prim and proper, arrives at his new garrison post in the northwest frontier of British India. His  commander gives him a tour of the somewhat dilapidated fort, and of its surrounding local villages. You see, says the commanding officer, it's mostly camels and dust, but we do our best to keep up the morale of our men. On Mondays, we take the entire garrison out for an evening of drinks and carousing. Do you drink?Err, not really. stammers the young officer.Hmm, says the commander. On Tuesdays, we bring the troops to the local opium den. Do you smoke?I'm afraid I do not. replies the young officer, apologetically. The commander, concerned that the puritanical nature of his new officer will result in him hating this posting, tries harder. On Wednesdays, we allow all the men an evening of pleasure at the brothels! The young officer whispers with downcast eyes, That just wouldn't seem proper, sir.A flash of anger comes over the commander's face, which turns to frustration, and then narrow-eyed suspicion. You don't drink, you don't smoke, and you won't enjoy yourself with women. Surely you're not one of those .. homosexuals?My goodness, no! protested the young officer.Well then, says the commander.

Shakespear was out of his playwriting prime and decided to settle down... Having loved animals all his life, he decides to open a pet store.Everybody had heard of the famous shakespear, and wanted to know what he was up to now, so they often came to visit him at his pet store. They would often buy his pets too, just so they could say that they bought a pet from shakespear himself.One day, all his animals had been rehomed except for two old, mangy cats. One orange tabby, and one solid black. Nobody wanted these cats, as they would hiss at anybody who tried to touch them.Eventually, an old lady comes in, looking for a cat. Shakespear, exasperated, shows her the two cats that he has left. Miraculously, the black one immediately starts rubbing his head on the lady's leg and purrs loudly.

The perfect kitty for you!The lady becomes reluctant however, and says but look at all the beautiful patterns of that orange one!After looking for a few more seconds, she turns back and says to herself, but this one is so friendly...She repeats this many times, looking back and forth, unable to choose.

A Tampa man dies and goes to Hell. A Tampa man dies and goes to hell.When he gets there, the devil comes over to welcome him. The devil then says, Sometimes it gets pretty uncomfortable down here.The man says, No problem. I’m from Tampa.So the devil goes over to the thermostat, turns the temperature up to 100, and the humidity up to 80. He then goes back to the Tampa man to see how he’s doing. To the devil’s surprise, the man is doing just fine.No problem…just like Tampa in June, the man says.So the devil goes back over to the thermostat, and turns the temperature up to 150, and the humidity up to 90. He then goes back over to see how the Tampa man is doing. The man is sweating a little, but overall looks comfortable.No problem. Just like Tampa in July, the man says.So now the devil goes over to the thermostat, turns the temperature up to 200, and the humidity up to 100. When he goes back to see how the man is doing, the man is sweating profusely, and has taken his shirt off. Otherwise, he seems OK.He says, No problem. Just like Tampa in August.Now the devil is really perplexed. So he goes back to the thermostat, and turns the temperature down to MINUS 150 DEGREES. Immediately, all the humidity in the air freezes up, and the whole place (meaning Hell) becomes a frigid, barren, frozen, deathly cold wasteland.When he goes back now to see how the Tampa man is doing, he is shocked to discover the man is jumping up and down, and cheering in obvious delight. The devil immediately asks the man what’s going on. To which the Tampa man replies…..THE RAYS WON THE WORLD SERIES!! !THE RAYS WON THE WORLD SERIES!!	!

In the beginning, when Man was first created, all the members of the body held a meeting to decide who should be in charge. The brain said that it should be in charge because it had the power of decision making and so controlled what everything else in the body did. The eyes pointed out that they were the ones who saw everything, including whatever objectives the brain was going to decide to pursue, so they should be in charge. The arsehole tried to say something at this point but was interrupted:  The ears said that they should be in charge because not even the eyes could look in all directions at once, whereas the ears were vigilant no matter which way the body was facing, and could even warn of danger when the eyes were shut. The heart said this was all very well, but without the tireless work it did in bringing blood to all parts of the body neither the brain nor the eyes nor the ears would last half a minute, so the heart should be in charge. Again the arsehole started to speak but was shouted down. The stomach pointed out that it had to process food before the heart would have anything worth carrying around, so it ought to be in charge. The hands said that they were the ones responsible for picking up whatever the brain decided on and the eyes saw, and without them the stomach would never get anything, so they should be in charge. The legs commented that they were the ones actually responsible for taking the body from place to place, so they ought to be in charge. The arsehole made a final attempt to put its case, but everyone else told it to piss off and shut the fuck up. This upset the arsehole so it decided to go on strike and see how everyone else liked it. Pretty soon the brain was feeling faint, the eyes had spots before them, the ears were ringing, the heart was fluttering, the stomach was queasy, the hands were clammy and the legs were wobbly. They all asked the arsehole very politely to get back to work, but the arsehole said that they'd had their chance to be nice about it and there was no way it was going back to work unless it could be in charge. And while the other parts of the body tried to hold out, it soon became clear that unless the arsehole got its way things were going to just get worse and worse, so eventually there was nothing for it but to give in.	And from that day to this, whenever there is a body or organisation of any sort, there's always an arsehole in charge.

Fly. A fly flies back and forth over a river repeatedly, dropping five inches each time.	A fish sees it and decides it will jump and catch it when it drops.A bear sees the fish and decides it will get the fish when it jumps.A hunter with a cheese sandwich in his pocket sees the bear and waits for it to go for the fish to shoot it.A mouse sees the cheese sandwich and decides to wait for the hunter to shoot so that the sandwich will fall and he can get it.A cat sees the mouse and decides to wait for it to go for the sandwich to jump and catch it.So, the fly drops, the fish jumps, the bear goes for it, the hunter shoots, the sandwich falls, the mouse goes for it, and the cat jumps, but he misses and goes into the water.The moral of the story: when the fly drops five inches, the pussy gets wet.

Two of the women thought it would be a fun way to end their outing while the third one was a bit more skeptical.

I would like for you to join me on a wonderful adventure into your minds. *The two women were excited for the experience while the skeptical one rolled her eyes. Miss Catarina acknowledge the gesture. * **Miss Catarina**: *I see we have a disbeliever in the room. In what way would I be able to lessen your uncertainty? *Skeptical Woman: How about you start by guessing our names. * **Miss Catarina**: *And that is exactly what I will do! However, uncovering the names of you three would be way too simple for Miss Catarina. One may say I overheard you addressing each other during a recent debate about coming in here. * (She says with a smirk)The faces of the other two women were filled with amazement. * **Miss Catarina**: *I will predict the names of your children and explain some history behind why it was chosen! *Thinking that there could be no way that she would know, the skeptical woman agreed. Miss Catarina starts with the first two. * **Miss Catarina**: *Hello my little Princess, your name has to be Penelope! *The first woman was stun while Penelope looked to her mom confused. * **Miss Catarina**: *I see you are confused my child, but be no more. You would most likely recognize your name as Penny! It is short for Penelope! Do you know why your name is Penny? It’s because your mommy loves collecting money! All kinds of money! Old money, new money and even foreign money! *The first two women cheered while confirming that it is correct. The third woman was a bit shocked but still skeptical. * **Miss Catarina**: *It was nice meeting you, Penelope! *She then moves to the second child. * **Miss Catarina**: *Hello my little Angel. You must be Lillian! ** **Lillian**: *Yes! But everyone calls me Lilly! ** **Miss Catarina**: *And I bet that is because your mommy loves flowers! All types of flowers! Wild flowers, house flowers and even exotic flower! *The two women confirmed with excitement! But now the skeptical woman is concern. * **Miss Catarina**: *It’s a pleasure meeting you, Lillian. *Saving the best for last, she walks over to the third child. * **Miss Catarina**: *And you my handsome Prince. Your name is the most fitting of all! * While feeling embarrassed, the skeptical woman cuts off Miss Catarina. * **Skeptical Woman**: *I’ve had enough! My son and I do not want to hear what you have to say! We’re leaving! *While looking at the sad little boy getting taken out the shop, Miss Catarina shouts to him. * **Miss Catarina**: *You have a wonderful day, Richard!	*

Phil Smith’s Scrotum. Suzie Smith stood up and walked to the podium. She said, I have a praise. Two months ago, my husband, Phil, was in a terrible bicycle wreck and his scrotum was completely crushed. The pain was excruciating and the doctors didn't know if they could help him.A muffled gasp arose from the men in the congregation as the thought of the pain poor Phil must have experienced sank in.Phil was hurt so badly that he couldn't even hold me or the kids, Suzie continued. Every movement caused terrible pain. We prayed when his doctors performed the delicate operation required to repair the extensive damage. Luckily they were able to piece the crushed and broken remnants of Phil's scrotum together and wrap it in wire to hold everything in place.Again, the male half of the congregation squirmed uncomfortably, cringing at the thought of what Phil went through.Today, Suzie announced in a quivering voice, Thanks to the Lord, Phil is out of the hospital. His doctors say that with time, his scrotum should recover completely.A great sigh of relief arose from the pews. The shaken pastor stood and tentatively asked if anyone else had anything to say.A man stood up and walked slowly to the podium. He looked around the congregation and said, I'm Phil.	The entire assembly held its collective breath.I just want to tell my wife that the word is sternum.

Lasik Eye Surgery. A few years ago, I finally decided to get Lasik Eye Surgery. I had been going to the same eye doctor for a few years, and she told me I was a good candidate for it. She tells me I need to get a topography test which couldn't be done at her office. Instead, she sent me to the Eye Center at a local hospital. While I was there, I asked if this was same building I would go when it came time for the actual procedure. They confirmed that it was.The time for the surgery came, and I show up at the same wing of the hospital, which was rather large. They apologized and said I was in the wrong building. I actually needed to go across the street which was a main road but was still considered part of the hospital. I asked the name of the building I was looking for, and they said it was the Urology building next to a Starbucks (go figure). I asked, Are you sure? I have to go to the Urology Center for eye surgery? Apparently, the Urology Center was the only building with rooms large enough to house the machine they used to perform the surgery.Everything went well once I found the building, and my eyes turned out fine.	After relaying this story to my dad a few days later, he said, Well, it's a good thing you didn't end up cock-eyed.

Three men walk into a bar. They all rub their heads from the pain. A duck follows them . . . . (OC!!!) Three men walk into a bar. They all rub their heads from the pain.

The duck says to ask the horse sitting next to him - he looks pretty sad. The horse replies that he wants two shots and to put it on the ducks tab.

So the man thinks and says, I wish I had a million bucks. The genie says, OK, go outside, and your wish will be granted. The man goes outside, but all he finds are ducks filling the sky and roads. He goes back in and tells his friend what happend, and his friend replies, I know. Did you really think I wanted a 12-inch pianist?3. A horse walks into a bar. The barman asks, Why the long face?4.

But, before they can go, Johnny needs to make sure they have a perfect night. So, Friday comes, and Johnny goes out to get his tuxedo. When he gets to the tux rental store, there's this ridiculously long line. But he needs the tux, so Johnny waits. And he waits, and waits until finally, he has his tux. Next, he needs a limo. So he goes to the limousine rental shop and finds that there's an even longer line there. But he needs the limo, so he waits. And he waits, and waits, and waits, until finally, he has the limo ordered. Johnny realizes he needs some new kicks, so he stops by a shoe store to get himself some nice shoes. When he goes to pay, he sees the longest line yet. But he needs the shoes, so he waits. And he waits, and waits, and waits, and waits, and waits, until finally, he's got his new shoes. Saturday, Johnny's ready to pick up his girl. He drives over to her house, picks her up, and they head to prom. At the dance, they're having a great time, dancing, playing at the casino, hanging out with friends. Soon, though, Sally gets thirsty, and asks Johnny for a drink.

My longest Pickup line.(Its actually a poem) In the Garden of Eden, As everyone knows, Lives Adam and Eve, Without any clothes. In this garden, Were two little leaves, One covered Adam's, One covered Eve's. As the story goes on, Never the less to say, The wind came along, And blew the leaves away. At the sight, Adam did stare, There was Eve's treasure, All covered with hair. And wonder came, Under Eve's eyes, As Adam's thing, Started to rise. They found a spot, That suited them best, A nice big tree, Where they began to rest. Her legs spread wider, And wider apart, While thrill after thrill, Came into her heart. The head of Adam's thing, Peeked into the hole, And filled her with passion, Beyond her control. Backward and forward, His thing did slide, And Eve's treasure, Was all wet inside. The joy was good, She wouldn't let loose, Until Adam's thing, Was all out of juice. Then down through the years, People did screw, And now it is time, For me and you.	So pull down your pants, And lay in the grass, Cause I'm in the mood, For a piece of that ASS!

He wanders around for a bit until deciding on a gin, then would go and add some tonic to it. As he’s waiting in line he looks at his watch, realising he’s been waiting for 5 minutes. So he moves on.He goes over to where the vodka is, deciding that it would be nice with something mixed into it. Again, after waiting in line he looks at his watch to see he’s been waiting 5 minutes.Why are these lines so packed?	He thinks to himself, but decides to move on.He walks to where the beer dispenser is, but once again, the line hasn’t moved after 5 minutes.The same thing happens when he goes to the bourbon dispenser and even where the tea is located.So after all that time looking for drinks he realises something.There’s no punch-line.
A woman walks into the downtown welfare office, trailed by 15 kids... WOW, the social worker exclaims, Are they ALL YOURS??? Yep they are all mine, the flustered mumma sighs, having heard that question a thousand times before. She says, Sit down Leroy.

Well, this one he is Leroy, also. The social worker raises an eyebrow but continues. One by one, through the oldest four, all boys, all named Leroy. Then she is introduced to the eldest girl, named Leighroy!All right... says the caseworker, I'm seeing a pattern here. Are they ALL named Leroy? Their Momma replied, Well, yes - it makes it easier. When it is time to get them out of bed and ready for school, I just yell 'Leroy!' An' when it's time for dinner, I just yell 'Leroy!' an' they all come a runnin.' An 'if I need to stop the kid who's running into the street, I just yell 'Leroy' and all of them stop. It's the smartest idea I ever had, namin' them all Leroy.The social worker thinks this over for a bit, then wrinkles her forehead and says tentatively, But what if you just want ONE kid to come, and not the whole bunch?

Murphy and O'Brien calculate the depth of a well. Murphy and O'Brien go out into the woods, they come a clearing and see an abandoned well. Murphy said 'I wonder how deep that well is?' O'Brien said, 'There's one way we could figure it out'. Murphy says, 'What's that?' O'Brien says, 'We drop something down it, we time how long it takes to hit the bottom, you multiply that time 32 feet per second squared, the rate at which objects fall in a vacuum, subtract a little for wind resistance and we've got the depth of the well'. Murphy says, ' What are you going to drop down it?' Then O'Brien looked all around and he saw this big heavy log lying on the ground. Next he squats down by the log and, using his legs correctly, he gets it up onto his shoulders and staggers over to the edge of the well, tips it up, drops it into the well and they start to count, 'One hippopotamus, two hippopotamus, three .................... '  SPLASH!!!! Murphy said, 'Three seconds!' O'Brien said, 'Quick, multiply that time 32 feet per second squared!' '288 feet! ', Murphy said. 'Subtract a little for wind resistance, let's say 18 feet. The depth of that well is 270 feet deep'. As he finished the calculation Murphy shouts, 'LOOK OUT!!' and he pushed O'Brien backwards and a goat ran between them and jumped head first down the well. Murphy said, 'My God, I've never seen anything like that'. Just then a farmer walks into the clearing and said, 'What's going on here boys?' O'Brien says, 'We just figured out the depth of this well to be about 270 feet deep and then the strangest thing happened. A goat ran between the two of us and jumped head first down into the well.' The farmer says, 'Thank heaven it wasn't one of my goats.' Murphy says, 'How do you know it wasn't?'	And the farmer says, 'Because all of my goats are tethered to big heavy logs.'

There is a store in Spain that sells exquisite handmade writing instruments. This store has all kinds of bespoke fountain pens and rollerball pens and even ball point pens. There are pens made of fine hard woods and precious metals inlaid with all kinds of gems. These pens are all handmade by artisans who have been in the business for generations.But what really sets this shop apart is their ink master. Most people buy pens with black ink or blue ink or even red ink, mostly because they do not know the world of colors of ink available at this shop. These fine inks are carefully blended by this ink master, a prodigy among those with a sense for color. There are colors so deep you feel you could fall into them, so vibrant you'd think they were alive, and so bright you'd think they were on fire. Every color imaginable and some you can't even imagine are available here. However the ink master is rarely at the store, he travels the world sourcing ingredients for his magnificent inks. Velvet Red ink made from the shell of a Japanese beetle. Royal blue ink made from the petals of an African flower that only blooms once every four years.	Making sure these ingredients are available for his customers keeps this whiz of ink away for months sometimes years at a time.But while people come from all over the world to buy this artisan ink maker's products, very few ever actually think they'll get a chance to meet him.Because nobody expects the Spanish ink whiz is in.

All that money for refurbishing and advertising, how can I open a piano bar without a pianist.!? A guy walking by hears him yelling, looks in and says  Excuse me, did you need a pianist? I’m a piano player, I play really god, and even write my own songs. The barman asks him to audition. The pianist sits down at the baby grand and starts playing, and it’s a really good song. The barman asks him if he wrote the song and the pianist says that he did. The bar owner asks the name and the pianist says I call that one ‘Sit on my face, baby’. The barman is taken aback, but asks him to play another. He plays a really good tune, but then says that the name of it is ‘I stepped in a pile of dog shit’. He plays a few more, and they’re all great, but have foul names. The barman says, Look, I’ll give you the job on the condition that you never announce the name of your songs. The pianist agrees, and says he’ll be there for the grand opening. Grand opening night is a great success, the piano player is very popular, and he jokes with the crowd, sips a little wine, really gets everybody into it. At his break he goes into the rest room, and when he comes back, a lady says, Mister, do you know your zipper’s down and your dick is hanging out? The pianist smiles and says, Know it?	Hell, I wrote it!

Surprise dinner for the wife (long) During lunch at work, I ate 3 plates of beans (which I know I shouldn't). When I got home, my husband seemed excited to see me and exclaimed delightedly, Darling I have a surprise for dinner tonight. He then blindfolded me and led me to my chair at the dinner table. I took a seat and just as he was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. He made me promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned and went to answer the call. The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my husband was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a garbage dump! I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable! Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my husband returned, apologizing for taking so long. He asked me if I had peaked through the blindfold, and I assured him I had not.	At this point, he removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table, with their hands to their noses, chorused, Happy Birthday!

A very Canadian joke.

Engineers! Background information:In India we have long distance trains which are pulled using engines and have toilet facilities, and seats which double as beds. It issues two types of tickets one is to ride the train (used by people to travel short distances, 8-10hrs) and another is to ride the train and have a seat assigned (used for longer distances).We also have, in certain cities like Mumbai, a local train system, which is electric, has only seats (which people do sometimes use as beds) and no toilet facilities, usually running within the city or to closer by towns a short distance away, usually the entire journey is under 5hrsOnto the joke.5 doctors and 5 engineers had to go out of the city, so they had a short 5-6 hour travel in the long distance train. The doctors had purchased a ticket each and the engineers bought 1 ticket and split the cost. The ticket collector (TC) came around to check the tickets. He clipped the tickets of each of the doctors and in the meantime all the engineers went and hid in the toilet. The TC knocked on the door, it was opened ever so slightly and the single ticket was thrust out, the TC checked it, clipped it and gave it back. On the return journey, the doctors were angry to have spent money. They decided to use the same trick as the engineers. They bought 1 ticket amongst themselves, the engineers noted this and didn't buy any tickets at all. When the TC arrived the doctors and engineers all went to hide in the toilet. The doctors were smiling thinking the engineers would be fined, when there is a knock on their door asking for a ticket. One of the doctors hands out the ticket and the engineer who asked for it takes it and goes back to the toilet they have hidden in. The real TC comes the engineers repeat the process and their ticket is clipped, while the doctors are asked to step out and are all fined. The doctors are livid.They reach the city and there is a further train they need to take to reach their work place. The doctors decide they won't but any ticket and will trick the engineers. The engineers all purchase a ticket apiece. The TC comes and the doctors smugly get up to hide in the toilet and the engineers quietly sit and have their tickets clipped.	The doctors are all caught and fined again because there is no toilet in the local train.

The first was to walk barefoot across a trench filled with hot coals.The second, to drink a full quart of the most powerful spirit.Third, he had to enter a cave and, with a small set of tongs, remove a bad tooth from a vicious lioness. Lastly, he was told, he had to make love to the ugliest old crone in the village. Well, he pulled off his boots and told them to bring on the hot coals.

A guy is crawling through the desert, about to die of thirst and he comes across a magic talking snake... The snake tells the guy his name is Nate and he'll happily grant him three wishes, so the guy asks for water. Nate slaps his tail on the ground and a gallon of fresh, pure water appears, which the guy proceeds to drink.What's your second wish? Nate asks. The guy thinks for a second and says, I wish I was a king.Nate says, That's easy! slaps his tail on the ground, and a horse-drawn carriage arrives, with a driver, who leaps down and hands the guy a scepter and a crown, and holds the door open for the guy.The guy gets in and thanks Nate, who asks Alright, what's your final wish?The guy says, I wish this desert was a beautiful kingdom, with green rolling hills, and a magnificent castle for me to live in.Nate thinks about it and says, Well, that's kind of a lot. Tell ya what, I'll fulfill your final wish, but somewhere in your kingdom I'm gonna hide a lever. And if that lever is switched to the off position, all your wishes will disappear and you'll be back crawling through the desert. Is that fair?The guy agrees, Nate slaps his tail on the ground and the desert is transformed into a beautiful kingdom with green rolling hills and a magnificent castle off in the distance. So the guy gets into the carriage and tells the driver to set off for the castle. They start moving along at a pretty good clip when suddenly they hit a bump and the driver goes flying off.So the guy is freaking out, he climbs up to the driver seat and grabs the reigns but the horses won't slow down. He's pulling hard for them to stop, when he sees Nate up ahead right next to a big lever in the middle of the road.

He gets up and walks over to inspect the lever. It's still in the on position, but next to it is the flattened corpse of the magical talking snake.One of the townspeople comes up to him and ask, Why?

Butch the Rooster. Sarah was in the fertilized egg business. She had several hundred young pullets and ten roosters to fertilise the eggs.She kept records and any rooster not performing went into the soup pot and was replaced.This took a lot of time, so she bought some tiny bells and attached them to her roosters. Each bell had a different tone, so she could tell from a distance which rooster was performing. Now, she could sit on the porch and fill out an efficiency report by just listening to the bells.Sarah's favourite rooster, old Butch, was a very fine specimen but, this morning she noticed old Butch's bell hadn't rung at all! When she went to investigate, she saw the other roosters were busy chasing pullets, bells-a-ringing, but the pullets hearing the roosters coming, would run for cover.To Sarah's amazement, old Butch had his bell in his beak, so it couldn't ring. He'd sneak up on a pullet, do his job, and walk on to the next one.Sarah was so proud of old Butch, she entered him in a Show and he became an overnight sensation among the judges.The result was the judges not only awarded old Butch the No Bell Peace Prize they also awarded him the Pulletsurprise as well. Clearly old Butch was a politician in the making.Who else but a politician could figure out how to win two of the most coveted awards on our planet by being the best at sneaking up on the unsuspecting populace and screwing them when they weren't paying attention?Vote carefully in the next election.	You can't always hear the bells.

A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest.After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.The distressed woman wailed, Are you sure?Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead, replied the vet..How can you be so sure? she protested.. I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.The vet looked at the woman and said, I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. $1,500! she cried,$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!The vet shrugged, I'm sorry.	If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500.

found while browsing Quora. Donald Trump, Theresa May, and Angela Merkel are walking outside after a particularly stressful diplomatic meeting.As they walk in silence, one of them stumbles on a small rock - but when they investigate, they find it is not a rock at all, but an antique oil lamp.Maybe there's a genie, says Donald. The women seem skeptical, but the three of them pry the lamp from the ground, and together, they rub it.Sure enough, a genie pops out. The mystical creature floats above them, sweet smelling smoke hanging around him as he smiles down upon the three world leaders.You have summoned me, the genie says. You may have one wish each.The Donald does not hesitate. The American people voted for me to build a wall, he says, So, I want you to build a big, beautiful wall around the USA.The genie claps his hand, and a mighty thunderclap sounds. It is done, he booms.Theresa May thinks, then says, The British people voted for Brexit, so we could have control of our borders, she says. I'd like a strong and stable wall around the UK.Another clap. It is done.Now, Merkel looks thoughtful. Before I make my wish - can I ask, what are the walls like?The genie says, Each wall is 500 feet tall. They are 50 feet wide. The foundations go down another 200 feet. And nothing can get in or out.Excellent, Merkel says, a rare grin crossing her face.	Fill them both with water.

Two guys are drinking at a penthouse bar at the top of a skyscraper in Chicago... One guy says to the other, ya know, when it gets really windy out there, like tonight, you can just float out the window. It's awesome! The other guy's not a complete idiot, so he says, whadda ya think, I'm stupid? I wasn't born yesterday. I don't care how windy it is out there. It can't hold up a grown man.You don't believe me? Watch this! and the first guy climbs carefully out the window and hold onto the sash for dear life, while the rest of his body is just floating in the wind. When he comes back inside, the second man is astounded. He's still not about to try it, but he's willing to admit it's pretty, damn cool. After a few more drinks the first guy starts egging him on again, you really gotta try it. Best rush you'll ever feel. Here, I was just getting used to it the first time. Watch this!So, the first guy leaps out the window and just floats there. Then, he turns over and acts like he's doing a backstroke. He dips, he dives, he rides the wind back up and into the window, safe once more. Finally, the second guy is so intrigued he HAS to try it. He knocks back one more shot, rolls up his sleeves (for some reason) and jumps out the window, falling 110 stories to his grisly, gruesome death.Back up at the bar, the bartender looks over at guy number one and say, You know something, Superman?

A pilot, a captain, and a driver were all stuck in a blimp headed straight towards a city. The pilot, wanting to save himself from crashing, says let me steer this blimp off course and land us safely. As a pilot, I have years of experience controlling flying vehicles. A blimp surely can’t be much different from a plane.The captain then butted in and said No, let me take the wheel. As a captain, I have handled many large boats and saved my crew countless times from stormy seas. A blimp is just as large and slow as a ship, so surely I’ll be able to handle it.As the pilot and the captain were arguing over who would take control of the blimp, it got closer and closer to crashing into the city.	After about 10 minutes, they both looked at the driver.The driver said nothing, becuse it’s a golf club, and it cannot speak.The blimp crashed into the city causing 131 deaths and 327 injuries.

Several years ago, Great Britain funded a study to determine why the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft... ...The study took two years and cost over 1.2 million pounds. The study concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to provide the man with more pleasure during sex. After the results were published, France decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. They were convinced that the results of the British study were incorrect. After three years of research at a cost of in excess of 2 million Euros, the French researchers concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex. When the results of the French study were released, Australia decided to conduct their own study. The Aussies didn't really trust British or French studies. So, after nearly three hours of intensive research and a cost of right around 75 dollars (three cases of beer), the Aussie study was complete.	They concluded that the reason the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent your hand from flying off and hitting you in the forehead.

A vegan seeks to sue every animal-product company on the planet. As he walks in to the courthouse, he can not help but feel the overwhelming pressure of his case. He revisits the paths of his life that have lead him to this moment, from the persuasion of a former love to abstain from animal products, to the spiritual awakening that causes him to become a paragon of the helpless victims of the maniacal animal-slaying corporate malefactors. The decision that if he was to ever decisively win the war for all herbivore-and-animal-kind, he must sever every head of the hydra at once. As he makes his way to his seat past the hundreds of wealthy CEO’s, each with the smug smirk of an easy victory wiped across their faces, his heart begins to pound rapidly. *WHY ON GOD’S GREEN EARTH DID I EVER DECIDE TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THIS* His profuse sweat is noticeably visible to the jurors, who can’t help but shake their heads in dismay at a case that was all but finished before it ever began.	The judge,  who pitied the poor vegan and the plight of his surely-doomed mission, motions for the court to be seated...............Lettuce commence.
[Long] This wealthy couple from New York made a trip down south... To visit some relatives that retired down in Florida. They were big foodies and decided to make a stop in Tennessee because they had never had good southern food but had heard how good it was. They find a hole in the wall southern food joint and pulled their new Range Rover in between two old beat up trucks. The restaurant wasn't really full yet because it was just before 11am but they were hungry from the long drive. Their were only 2 middle aged men sitting at a table in the corner of the room. They were wearing overalls that were dirty and they probably had 10 teeth between the both of them. Excited to try the food, the young rich couple got a little of everything but was most excited to try the fried chicken. While the wife is taking a picture of her food, her husband begins to choke on a chicken bone. The wife freaks out and starts screaming for someone to help.

The other hillbilly gets on his knees and starts licking the other hillbilly's asshole. All of a sudden the husband begins to gag as he sees a man licking another man's asshole. The husband then throws up from being completely grossed out and along with it the chicken bone, saving his life.	The two hillbillies stand up and as they are walking back to their lunch, the 1st hillbilly says  See there Jim Bo, I told ya that there hind lick maneuver would work

Just heard this variation on an oldie! A hat maker was trying to sell his hats on a hot summers day. After having no luck for 4 hours under the sun, he decided to take a short rest underneath a gigantic tree. He set his briefcase of hats down, took one out to cover his face, and laid down on the grass. With the shade from his hat and the warmth of the ground beneath him, he felt drowsy and quickly fell asleep. When he woke up an hour later, he was startled to find that his briefcase was open, and his hats were missing.He then heard a curious sound above him. only to notice that the tree was filled with chatty monkeys all wearing his hats! He quickly tried offering them sticks or dropped fruits in exchange for his hats, but the monkeys seemed to only make fun of him. Furious, he threw a stick at one of the monkeys, which resulted in a shower of thrown sticks back at him. Ducking for cover, he backed off to another nearby tree where he thew his hat down in frustration. To his amazement, the monkeys, seemingly copying him, threw their hats down as well! He quickly picked up his hats and ran away. The hat maker went on to have a very successful business, getting married and having many children and eventually grandchildren. He passed on his knowledge of the trade to his oldest son before retiring, who upheld the family business and eventually passed it on to his oldest son as was tradition. A few generations passed, and the new owner and grandson of the hat maker was selling hats on a hot day, when he too decided to take a short rest underneath a very similar tree. One thing lead to another, and he found himself waking up to his hats having been stolen by monkeys! However, he remembered the old story his grandfather had told him about outwitting some monkeys, and threw his hat down. A single monkey climbed down the tree and took the hat before making a rude gesture and scurrying back up. Stumped and enraged, he screamed at the monkey.	The monkey replied: Hey idiot, you're not the only one with a grandfather.

Just as I got in the door, the cuckoo clock in the hallway started up and cuckooed 3 times.Quickly, realizing my wife would probably wake up, I cuckooed another 9 times.

There were two brothers.... One was very good and tried to always live right and be helpful. His brother, on the other hand, was bad and did all the things that men should not do and didn’t care who he hurt. The bad brother died. He was still missed by his brother since he loved him despite his ways.Finally, years later, the good brother died and went to Heaven. Everything was beautiful and wonderful there and he was very happy. One day he asked God where his brother was, as he hadn’t seen him there. God said that he wassorry but his brother lived a terrible life and went to Hell instead.The good brother then asked God if there was any way for him to see his brother. So God gave him the power of vision to see into Hell and there was his brother. He was sitting on a bench with a keg of beer under one arm and a gorgeous blonde on the other.Confused, the good brother said to God, I am so happy that you let me into Heaven with You. It is so beautiful here and I love it. But I don’t understand, if my brother was bad enough to go to Hell, why does he have the keg of beer and a gorgeous blonde.

Who's the boss now? After God created man, all parts of his body decided they'd need a boss to function efficiently. The brain stood up and claimed the title explaining its importance as an organ.

There was once a 10 year old little boy. Riding his blue bicycle in his mountain town. He hears a strange, unfamiliar bell coming from the top of the nearby mountain. He decides to investigate the next day. He wakes up extra early at 7am and begins his summit to find the bell. He arrives at the top of the mountain after a long 12 hour bike ride. There is a large monastery, where the sound has originated. He knocks on the door and a monk answers. Hello said the boy. Yes? Replies the monk.I heard a bell coming from here yesterday, I’d like to know what it was. Asked the boy. The monk replied, I’m sorry, I can’t tell you, you’re not a monk.The boy made the long ride back down the mountain and forgot about the bell. 6 years later on his 16 birthday, he bought his first car. The same day, he heard the strange bell again, and decided to investigate again, maybe he’d have better luck this time. He took his car and drove 2 hours up the mountain to the monastery. The same monk opened the door, and they had the same interaction as before, what’s the sound I’m sorry, I can’t tell you, you’re not a monk. So again the boy departed home. 15 years later, the boy is now a man, married, with 3 beautiful children and a red sports car. He hears the bell one day after work, and speeds up the mountain, this time he’s there in an hour and fifteen minutes. He arrives at the monastery and has the same interaction as the two previous times. So finally he says I want to be a monk, to find out what that noise is. The monk said, First, you must sell your car, divorce your wife, abandon your kids and all your possessions, when you’re done, we can begin. The man does what he’s told and comes back a month later. The monk is pleased to see him. Take off your clothes, put on these robes and shave your head the man complies. Am I a monk now? No, now read this encyclopedia and memorize everything, then you’ll be closer to being a monk. The man memorized every word in the book and informs the other monk. It has taken him 4 years. Am I a monk now? The man pleaded, no, Now I want you to find the needle in the hayfield out in the courtyard, then cut each blade of grass with scissors. This task takes the man 10 years. Am I a monk ? Yes, you’re a monk what is the bell the monk points to a door down the corridor. The new monk opens the door to see another, slightly smaller door. Then another. And another, until he’s only able to reach his arms through to open them.	And finally he learns what the sound was, do you want to know what it is?I’m sorry I can’t tell you, you’re not a monk

Joe is unhappy because hell looks like more fun than heaven. Well says St Peter its not quite as nice as it seems.

If I don't ride that helicopter this year, I may never get another chance.

I'll take both of you for a ride; if you can both stay quiet for the entire ride and not say a word I won't charge you! But if you say just one word, it's 50 dollars.Walter and Ethel agreed and up they went in the helicopter.

He gives each woman a present of $5,000 and wanted to see what they would do with the money.The first does a total makeover. She goes to a fancy beauty salon, gets her hair done, new makeup; buys several new outfits and dresses up very nicely for the man. She tells him that she has done this to be more attractive for him because she loves him so much. The man was impressed.The second goes shopping to buy the man gifts. She gets him a new set of golf clubs, some new tech for his computer, and some expensive clothes. She tells him that she has spent all the money on him because she loves him so much. Again, the man is impressed.The third invests the money on the stock market. She earns several times the $5,000. She gives him back his $5,000 and reinvests the remainder in a joint account. She tells him that she wants to save for their future because she loves him so much. Obviously, the man was impressed.The man thought for a long time about what each woman had done with the money he’d given her.	Then he married the one with the biggest boobs.

A long time ago... For many years, a small indian village had been mistreated by a great fire breathing dragon. All the villages were too scared to even leave their houses at night, that was except for a young man named Urkake. Urkake was a fearless fighter who swore to the village that he would slay the dragon before their very eyes!The following night the dragon appeared. This time the villages filed out of their homes as Urkake made his stand. *Swish Swoosh Ching Clank Oof Reawwww*.There it lay. As useless as a catapult. Slain by the great Urkake.	The day was celebrated in his honour and every year when it came around the villagers would worship his name.Over the years the memory of Urkake faded and only a few people remembered the great feat he had achieved.If you look around today you will probably find that nobody cares if its Urkake day.

A man had excruciating headaches. So he decided once and for all to go see a specialist to see what can be done. After extensive scans and tests the doctor calls him in and gives him the bad news. I'm very sorry sir, you have a very rare case in which your nuts press up against the base of your spine which, in turn, is causing you these headaches.So the man asks what can be done, and the doctor responds regretfully that the only solution he can think of is to cut off his balls. The man is understandably upset but decides that there is nothing to be done and he can't live with these headaches any longer and so they schedule the surgery. The day of the surgery arrives, and everything goes smoothly. In recovery, the doctor sees the man is very depressed his jewels are gone for good and goes up to him to try and cheer him up. You know, just outside the hospital there is a very good tailer, why don't you give him a visit and get yourself some new clothes to feel better?The guy agrees that this might make him feel a little better and after getting discharged walks into this little tailor shop next to the hospital. As he walks in he hears, size 7 hat!Looking around he spots a diminutive old man in a tweed vest peering at him. What did you say? asks the man. I said size 7 hat, that is your hat size, no? answered the tailor. Well I don't know, I was never really a hat man, how did you know?I have been doing this for 55 years. I can look at someone for a few seconds and tell you all their measurements!The man, disbelieving, decides to put this claim to the test. Oh yeah? What's my shoe size?42, came the prompt response. Shirt size?18. 'Incredible,' thinks the man, 'this guy is good! 'What about my pants size?44, came the answer. Aha!	exclaimed the man, I have worn size 42 pants my whole life!Impossible, scoffed the tailor, if you would wear size 42 pants, your nuts would press up against the base of your spine and cause you extreme headaches!

Farmer's Dilemma. A farmer had some wolves take out a couple of his best young chickens, a pullet (young female chicken) and a cock (male chicken). He heard that his neighbor down the road had a few fine chickens for sale so he decided to walk over to see if he could strike a deal.The farmer arrives at his neighbors place and after some haggling gets a great deal on a new pullet and cock. While he is there he sees an old ass for sale and he asks the neighbor if he thinks that he could use it to haul things back on the farm. The neighbor replied that he is a good worker but occasionally he will stop and you have to scratch his belly to get him moving again. He again gets a good deal and marches off triumphantly with his pullet under one arm, cock under the other, and the reigns of his new ass in his hand. The farmer gets about halfway back to his farm when the ass stops moving. He cant scratch its belly since he would have to set down a chicken and risk it running off. Unsure what to do he sees a carriage coming down the road which he promptly beckons.	A woman exits the carriage asking if he needs assistance to which he replies, could you hold my cock and pullet while I scratch my ass?

Four friends walk into a forest... This is my favourite and go-to joke and further elaborations and movements fitting those of the fourth person add to the joke:Four friends walk into a forest and close to the path they walk on they see a fairy trapped beneath a fallen tree. They decide to help her out and once they have lifted the tree the fairy thanks all of them and says: I will grant all four of you 3 wishes but you need to make those after a time span of 3 years each. The first one answers: I would like to have 1000$ in cash right now! The fairy says: No problem! and hands the first guy his thousand dollars. The second guy continues to make his wish: My ford fiesta is a nice car but I would really like to drive an Audi A6                  Your wish shall become truth and the Audi is already parked in your garage at home., says the fairy. Guy Nr. 3 is now at the row to make his wish: My flat isn't really that big and I definitely need more space if I want to start a family, so I would like to own a nice single-family house in the suburbs with a nice little garden. No problem, says the fairy, The keys to your new house and its address are inside of your letterbox back at your flat.The last of the friends now asks the fairy: You know what would be really cool? If my head was spinning around in circles. No problem, says the fairy and the last guys head starts to spin around in circles. Three years later the four friends meet up again to see the fairy and make their second wishes. Once arrived the first guy makes his wish: The thousand dollars you gave me were really nice but after only 3 weeks I had already spent them so this time I wish for a million dollars in my bank account! No problem, says the fairy, The money you wish for is now in your bank account. The second one now makes his turn: The Audi you gave me handles really well and it's also pretty fast but I would really enjoy a faster car. This time I wish for a Porsche! No problem, says the fairy. Additionally to your Audi I now placed a Porsche in your garage. The third guy proceeds: The house I wished for is quite beautiful but I would like to have a bit more room and luxury. I wish for a big mansion close to the sea! No problem, says the fairy, The keys and location of your mansion are now placed in a letter sent to your current address. The fourth guy, still spinning his head, now makes his wish: You know fairy, it's pretty awesome that my head is now spinning all the time but it would be really really cool if my left arm was also spinning around in circles! No problem, says the fairy and the last guys left arm now begins to spin.Three years later the four friends meet up one last time to see the fairy and make their final wishes. Once arrived the first guy makes his wish: Being a millionaire is a really nice thing but it would be quite awesome to be the richest guy in the world! No problem, says the fairy, You are now the richest man in the world and all the money in the world summed up is now in your bank account. The second one now makes his turn: The Porsche you gave me is really fast and way more fun to drive than the Audi but I wish to have the ability to get all sports cars and luxury cars I wish for! No problem, says the fairy. I expanded your garage and whenever you wish for a car it's already inside next to all the other sporty cars and you will be able to drive a different sports car every day of the year. The third guy now proceeds: I really enjoy living in that big mansion by the sea but the only thing that would be even better would be my very own island with an even bigger mansion on it. No problem, says the fairy, The boatsman on your private yacht will take you to your very own private island. The fourth guy, still spinning his head and his left arm, now makes the final wish: You know fairy, it's pretty awesome that my head and my left arm are now spinning all the time but it would be really really cool if my right arm was also spinning around the whole time in the opposite direction as my left arm! No problem, says the fairy and the last guys right arm now begins to spin.The four friends now meet each other in a bar after another three years has passed. And they start to talk about what has happened since the fairy granted them the wishes. The first guy starts talking about his life: My wealth is now big enough that there isn't a word to describe the number it has reached since I invested and multiplied it that often! That's pretty awesome, says the second guy, I now drive the newest prototype cars since experiencing a different car every day gave me the ability to give the best of feedback to the car manufacturers while I even get paid for driving  those multi-million dollar cars around. The third guy now speaks about his very own wealth: I now own 50 additional islands and have built the most luxurious holiday resorts and earn a lot of money through that.	The last guy, still spinning his head and both arms around in circles now says: Guys, I think my wishes were bullshit.

A farmer finds one of his pigs dead in his pasture. Without haste, the farmer phones the police and animal control requesting for assistance with the removal of the massive giant and dispose of it humanely. After 10 minutes had passed, a police cruiser with two constables and an animal control van with two animal control officers arrive on the scene and begin their duties.The two animal control officers quickly get to work with lifting the behemoth swine into their van, while the two constables interview the farmer on what happened. The farmer tells his story, giving every single detail of what happened and claims that the death of his pig was due to the pesticides he may have used for dusting his crops, but suggests the officers that they should investigate further as the farmer tells them that strangers have been coming onto his property at the late hours of the evening trying to sneak away with a new crop the farmer had recently planted. The constables agree and confer with the AC officers to give them details upon their findings as they perform an autopsy at their control centre.A few days pass and the constables receive news from animal control via phone call and tell them they are sending the dissected pig to their morgue for further examination. Ten minutes later, the same two AC officers arrive with the pig in the van and are led by the constables to the morgue with two large Tupperware containers in hand. They arrive in the morgue and begin to pull out the carcass, piece by piece onto the gurney in front of them. Then one of the AC officers pulls out three plastic bags full of greenery covered in mucus. One of the constables askes what they are and the AC officers says it's marijuana. The constables rush the bags of assumed marijuana to the laboratory for further examination and the results were the greenery in the bags were indeed marijuana.Relieved that their findings were true, one of the constables phones the farmer to give the news. The farmer answers the phone and the constable tells him of his findings.Sir, we have some news on your late pig, the constable starts, after our findings from animal control, we have found that your swine ate a plentiful amount of greenery which caused the sudden death of it.And? Was it resulted from some pesticide I had used? The farmer questioned very curiously.Fortunately, no, the constable begins, your pig ingested a heavy amount of marijuana which in turn caused your pig to overdose.The farmer relieved by the constable's news, made light of the situation, saying, Well, I guess I finally figured out what breed of pigs I'm raising.And what breed would that be, sir?	The constable asks.The farmer let out a hearty chuckle before he replied, Pot-bellied pigs.

Twist & expansion of the fly in the beer story. A bar in FRANCE has an amateur social scientist as a bartender. He's decided to put flies into the beers of a customers, to measure and document the reactions of people of different nationalities. Since he fancies himself as a chivalrous gentleman, he doesn't do this with female customers (actually, he doesn't want to ruin any chance he has of getting them into his bed, or the back room.) So his targets are men.Here is his experiment journal.Monday:Subject #1: Englishman, age approximately 40. Called me over and said he couldn't drink the beer because of the fly and demanded another on the house.Subject #2: Welshman, age approximately 50-60. Called me over and flicked the fly at me while swearing in Welsh. Then he started sipping his beer as if nothing happened.Tuesday:Subject #3: Irishman, age approximately 65. Was so drunk that he didn't notice the fly, gulping it down with the beer, then ordered another jus' da same. I obliged him. Four more flies later, he settled his tab, and made his way out of the bar in a less than straight line.Subject #4: American, age approximately 25. Yelled at me to come back, threw the beer in my face, and started a bar brawl.Wednesday: Dedicated to repairing bar, no customers.Thursday:Subject #5: Scotsman, age approximately 35. Horrified upon seeing the fly (I think you know where this is going), picked it out of the beer and screamed at it repeatedly, Spit it out! Spit it out!. For the next beer, he demanded an extra ounce on the house, on account of the fly having drunk some of his previous beer.Subject #6: Canadian, age approximately 25-30. Very quiet. When he paid for his beer, the fly was on the Euro bills and he said, No thank you. You can have the fly back.Friday:Subject #7: German, age approximately 30-40. Demanded to see the manager and complained to her that I had dishonoured his fine beverage. Suggested to my manager that I was unfit for my job, and that he deserved the most expensive beer we have for free as compensation.My manager questioned me about the fly, suspicious. She's smarter than I thought, despite her not sleeping with me. She asked me about the brawl on Tuesday, if I had done something to set off the American. I said it might be possible, but who knows what sets them off? She agreed, but warned me that if anything goes wrong during my shift again, I would lose my employee discount.Saturday:The owner is working today instead of the manager. Since the manager won't sleep with the owner either, he probably doesn't know about the fly incident. Onward with my experiment.Subject #8: Iranian, age approximately 20-50. Saw the fly, then praised Allah for showing him the error of his ways, then left.The owner didn't want the beer to go to waste, so put it into the refrigerator. He didn't notice the fly.Subject #9: Sudanese refugee, age 42. For some reason my knowing his age was important, like he was bragging. I gave him the beer that the owner put in the fridge. When he saw the fly, he started yelling loudly that he shouldn't be treated this way, that he should get the same as everyone else. The owner came over to see what was going on. He asked me why I was treating the refugee differently, I said that I wasn't, that I had been putting flies in most of the beers. He laughed and repeated this to the refugee, who spluttered and swore on his way out the door.Why are you putting flies in the beer?, asked the owner. I told him about my experiment, minus the bar brawl. Obviously.Well, it's just beer, the cretins, they should have wine like us French. They deserve it, he replied, but don't do it too much. I don't want to lose too many customers.I said, I'm only doing it to foreigners, but it would be interesting to see the reaction of a fellow Frenchman, if ever one orders a beer.Don't you dare put a fly in the wine!, growled the owner.Of, course Monsieur, I would never stoop so low!Saturday:Subject #10: A dark coloured American woman, age approximately 20-30. I broke my no women rule for her because she was extremely rude when I innocently asked her to the back room. When she saw the fly, she started screaming in some version of English that I couldn't understand, threw the beer at the owner (who came in specifically today to watch my experiment), jumped over the bar and hit me over the head with the beer stein. She and her 5 other young dark coloured American friends then started rampaging, smashing everything in sight. After what seemed like an eternity, they grabbed what few bottles were left unbroken and the cash from the cash box, before running out into the street.Sunday:The bar owner is in the hospital bed beside mine. He says that he has been telling me repeatedly that I am fired, but I keep forgetting it because of my head injury.That's OK, though, I love yelling it at you!	You're fired you damn fool!

So there's this joke about this boxer... I can't quite remember all the details, but they had a big thing for bullying. Their favorite pastime outside the ring was finding these really scrawny, wimpy people and just wrecking them. As an ego thing. So one day, if memory serves, this boxer decided to hold a little competition. Everyone I've ever beat up they said, can come downtown to my usual ring. I'll take you all on again, one right after another. So lo and behold, most of the people take the boxer up on it.

Now I don't remember much of the actual competition, sadly.	But I do know for certain that the punch line here was pretty weak.

An Irishman has been shipwrecked and stranded on an island for over 20 years. [MEDIUM] One day, on his daily walk of the beach, he sees something way out in the ocean. At first he couldn’t make out what it was, as it got closer, he could see something red. Finally, it was close enough to determine that the red was actually the hair of a woman. A very pretty dame in her 20s. When she arrived on shore she was surprised to find anyone there, as this is a very remote island. She walks up to the Irishman and asks him how he got there. He says I haven’t seen another soul in over 20 years since I was shipwrecked and stranded here.She says 20 years you say? Well, that’s a long time to go without a drink, she pulls down her wetsuit zipper a bit, reaches in and pulls out a bottle of Irish whiskey. How would you like a drink?He obliges and takes a couple of swallows. Bless your heart, that’s the best tasting whiskey I’ve had in me whole life.She says It’s been a long time since you’ve had a smoke, would you like a cigarette?He happily obliges and she pulls the wetsuit zipper down even farther and pulls out a pack of cigarettes and some matches. He lights the cigarette, has a few drags and says Bless your heart, that’s the best cigarette I’ve had in me whole life.She then says So you’ve been stranded here for over 20 years, how’d you like to play around? She pulls the wetsuit zipper down the rest of the way, exposing her naked body.	He responds  Oh bless your heart, you’ve got a set of clubs in there have you?

This is a bar! This is no place for whales! The bartender notices this upright whale is wearing a top hat and carrying a Scooby Doo lunchbox.How are you even walking on your fins? Don't you know you belong in the ocean, swimming? Like, I get it, whales are mammals so you can breathe air but don't you need to be wet? Won't you dry out on land?Becoming more and more flabbergasted, the bartender continues,Besides, why is a whale wearing a top hat? You're not wearing pants or a shirt. I get that animals don't need to wear clothes but now that you're wearing a hat and nothing else, it seems obscene. Wear a whole outfit or wear nothing at all! Besides, who brings a lunchbox to a bar? I get that whales typically eat plankton or some shit but we serve food here, you can't bring outside food, that's standard for any bar! And do you even have money? Do you know how much alcohol it'll take to get you drunk? You must weigh five tons! I don't even know if there is enough alcohol in this bar!

Jay Leno Joke. Two hunters are out and about in the bush when they suddenly approach a hole in the ground. The hole is pitch-black dark and they debate between themselves, how deep it might be? Quickly, one of them takes out a used bullet shell from his pocket and throws it into the hole. Nothing, they fail to hear it drop. The other hunter notices there's an anvil just by the hole and directs the other to help him lift and throw it into the hole. After considerable effort and at great expense of their backs, they manage to throw the anvil into the hole, but again are disappointed to not hear it hit the bottom. They stand over the hole, with their hands on their knees, squatting over to try and see if there's a bottom. Behind them there's a noise, some sound of trampling leaves and breaking branches in the bush. One hunter quickly grabs the other as a goat seemingly out of nowhere darts between them and straight into the hole. The hunters totally confused decide that it's time to get out of there and call it a day. As they head over to their truck parked on the side of a long narrow road there comes a farmer yelling Becky?? Becky?? and approaches the hunters to ask: hey have either of you seen a goat roaming around. One of the hunters replies: Yes, in fact we saw it jump into this hole and points in the direction of the bush where they just came from. The farmer replies: that's impossible, I had her tied an anvil.	\>>>>I heard this joke told by Jay Leno on a podcast deconstructing what makes for an effective joke<<<<

A man is driving down the road at midnight and his car breaks down near a mental hospital. He didn’t know what to do because he knew nothing about fixing cars. A mental patient who was watering some flowers saw the scene and walks towards the man. The man seeing the mental patient coming his way, gets scared and stays quiet in the car. The madman tells the man..-Good night my friend. Do you want me to fix your car? ... Since there was anything he can do , the man allows the mental patient to check his car. After a few minutes the car was as good as new. The man couldn’t believe it .. he says  Thanks man. You’re a master in mechanics. How are you locked up in a mental institution? ... - That’s nothing, I’m also an electrical engineer, master in computers and speak 5 languages .... the man , still amazed, replies  Listen , I’m a psychiatrist, I  will get you out of here tomorrow ... Thanks  says the mental patient. The man gets in his car and starts driving, a few seconds later, a brick coming his way at high speed, breaks the back windshield, hits the man in the back of the head so hard , that makes the man break the front windshield with his forehead. The man, bleeding profusely, with pieces of glass in his head and face, stops the car, and slowly looks backwards.	He sees the mental patient in the middle of the road who yells:-Don’t you forget.

Macaroni and Beef. This is not original, and not me, it is actually quite old (at least 1996) but I have not seen it here so here goes...Macaroni and BeefA couple of weeks ago we decided to cruise out to Ryan's Steakhouse for dinner. It was a Wednesday night which means that macaroni and beef was on the hot bar, indeed the only night of the week that it is served. Wednesday night is also kid's night at Ryan's, complete with Dizzy the Clown wandering from table to table entertaining the little bastards.It may seem that the events about to be told have little connection to those two circumstances, but all will be clear in a moment.We went through the line and placed our orders for the all-you-can-eat hot bar then sat down as far away from the front of the restaurant as possible in order to keep the density of kids down a bit. Then I started my move to the hot bar. Plate after plate of macaroni and beef were consumed that evening, I tell you -- in all, four heaping plates of the pseudo-Italian ambrosia were shoved into my belly. I was sated. Perhaps a bit too much, however.I had not really been feeling well all day, what with a bit of gas and such. By the time I had eaten four overwhelmed plates of food, I was in real trouble. There was so much pressure on my diaphragm that I was having trouble breathing. At the same time, the downward pressure was building. At first, I thought it was only gas which could have been passed in batches right at the table without too much concern.Unfortunately, that was not to be. After a minute or so it was clear that I was dealing with explosive diarrhea. It's amazing how grease can make its way through your intestines far faster than the food which spawned the grease to begin with, but I digress...Entering, I saw two sinks immediately inside the door, two urinals just to the right of the sinks, and two toilet stalls against the back wall. One of them was a handicapped bathroom. Now, normally I would have gone to the handicapped stall since I like to stretch out a bit when I take a good shit, but in this case, the door lock was broken and the only thing I hate worse than my wife telling me to stop cutting my toenails with a pair of diagonal wire cutters is having someone walk in on me while I am taking a shit. I went to the normal stall. In retrospect, I probably should have gone to the large, handicapped stall even though the door would not lock because that bit of time lost in making the stall switch proved to be a bit too long under the circumstances. By the time I had walked into the regular stall, the pressure on my ass was reaching Biblical proportions. I began The Move.For those women who may be reading this, let me take a moment to explain The Move. Men know exactly what their bowels are up to at any given second. And when the time comes to empty the cache, a sequence of physiological events occur that can not be stopped under any circumstances. There is a move men make that involves simultaneously approaching the toilet, beginning the body turn to position ones ass toward said toilet, hooking ones fingers into ones waistline, and pulling down the pants while beginning the squat at the same time. It is a very fluid motion that, when performed properly, results in the flawless expulsion of shit at the exact same second that ones ass is properly placed on the toilet seat. Done properly, it even assures that the choad is properly inserted into the front rim of the toilet in the event that the piss stream lets loose at the same time; it is truly a picture of coordination rivaling that of a ballet dancer.I was about half-way into The Move when I looked down at the floor and saw a pile of vomit that had been previously expelled by one of those little bastards attending kids night; it was mounded up in the corner so I did not notice it when I had first walked into the stall. Normally, I would not have been bothered by such a thing, but I had eaten so much and the pressure upward was so intense, that I hit a rarely experienced gag reflex. And once that reflex started, combined with the intense pressure upward caused by the bloated stomach, four plates of macaroni and beef started coming up for a rematch. What happened next was so quick that the exact sequence of events are a bit fuzzy, but I will try to reconstruct them as best I can.In that moment of impending projectile vomiting, my attention was diverted from the goings-on at the other end. To put a freeze frame on the situation, I was half crouched down to the toilet, pants pulled down to my knees, with a load of vomit coming up my esophagus. Now, most of you know that vomiting takes precedence over shit no matter what is about to come slamming out of your ass. It is apparently an evolutionary thing since shitting will not kill you, but vomiting takes a presence of mind to accomplish so that you do not aspirate any food into the bronchial tubes and perhaps choke to death. My attention was thus diverted. At that very split second, my ass exploded in what can only be described as a wake...you know, as in a newspaper headline along the lines of 30,000 Killed in Wake of Typhoon Fifi or something similar. In what seemed to be most suitably measured in cubic feet, an enormous plug of shit the consistency of thick mud with embedded pockets of greasy liquid came flying out of my ass. But remember, I was only half-way down on the toilet at that moment. The shit wave was of such force and of just such an angle in relation to the back curve of the toilet seat that it ricocheted off the back of the seat and slammed into the wall at an angle of incidence equal to the angle at which it initially hit the toilet seat. Then I sat down. Recall that when that event occurred, I was already half-way to sitting anyway and had actually reached the point of no return. I have always considered myself as relatively stable gravitationally, but when you get beyond a certain point, you're going down no matter how limber you may be. Needless to say, the shit wave, though of considerable force, was not so sufficient so as to completely glance off the toilet seat and deposit itself on the walls, unlike what you would see when hitting a puddle with a high-pressure water hose; even though you throw water at the puddle, the puddle gets moved and no water is left to re-form a puddle. There was a significant amount of shit remaining on about one third of the seat rim which I had now just collapsed upon. Now, back to the vomit...While all the shitting was going on, the vomit was still on its way up. By the time I had actually collapsed on the toilet, my mouth had filled up with a goodly portion of the macaroni and beef I had just consumed. OK, so what does the human body instinctively do when vomiting? One bends over. So I bent over. I was still sitting on the toilet, though. Therefore, bending over resulted in me placing my head above my now slightly opened legs, positioned in between my knees and waist. Also directly above my pants which were now pulled down to a point just midway between my knees and my ankles. Oh, did I mention that I was wearing not just pants, but sweat pants with elastic on the ankles. In one mighty push, some three pounds of macaroni and beef, two or three Cokes, and a couple of Big, Fat Yeast Rolls were deposited in my pants...on the inside...with no ready exit at the bottom down by my feet.In the next several seconds, there were a handful of farts, a couple of turds, and the event ended, yet I was now sitting there with my pants full of vomit, my back covered in shit that had bounced off the toilet, spattered on three ceramic tiled walls to a height of about five feet, and still had enough force to come back at me, covering the back of my shirt with droplets of liquid shit. All while thick shit was spread all over my ass in a ring curiously in the shape of a toilet seat. And there was no fucking toilet paper.What could I do but laugh. I must have sounded like a complete maniac to the guy who then wandered into the bathroom. He actually asked if I was OK since I was laughing so hard I must have sounded like I was crying hysterically. I calmed down just enough to ask him if he would get the manager. And told him to have the manager bring some toilet paper. When the manager walked in, he brought the toilet paper with him, but in no way was prepared for what happened next. I simply told him that there was no way I was going to explain what was happening in the stall, but that I needed several wet towels and I needed him to go ask my wife to come help me. I told him where we were sitting and he left. At that point, I think he was probably assuming that I had pissed just a bit in my pants or something similarly benign.About two minutes later, my wife came into the bathroom not knowing what was wrong and with a certain amount of worry in her voice. I explained to her (still laughing and having trouble getting out words) that I had a slight accident and needed her help. Knowing that I had experienced some close calls in the past, she probably assumed that I had laid down a small turd or something and just needed to bring the car around so we could bolt immediately. Until I asked her, I'm sure she had no idea that she was about to go across the street and purchase me new underwear, new socks, new pants, a new shirt, and (by that time due to considerable leakage around the elastic ankles thingies) new sneakers. And she then started to laugh herself since I was still laughing.She began to ask for an explanation as to what had happened when I promised her that I would tell her later, but that I just needed to handle damage control for the time being. She left.The manager then came back in with a half dozen wet towels and a few dry ones. I asked him to also bring a mop and bucket upon which he assured me that they would clean up anything that needed to be cleaned. Without giving him specific details, I explained that what was going on in that stall that night was far in excess of what I would expect anyone to deal with, what with most of the folks working at Ryan's making minimum wage of just slightly above.At that moment, I think it dawned on him exactly the gravity of the situation. Then that manager went so far above the call of duty that I will be eternally grateful for his actions. He hooked up a hose. Fortunately, commercial bathrooms are constructed with tile walls and tile floors and have a drain in the middle of the room in order to make clean up easy. Fortunately, I was in a commercial bathroom. He hooked up the hose to the spigot located under the sink as I began cleaning myself up with the wet towels. Just as I was finishing, my wife got back with the new clothes and passed them into the stall, whereupon I stuffed the previously worn clothing into the plastic bag that came from the store, handing the bag to my wife. I finished cleaning myself off and carefully put on my new clothes, still stuck in the stall since I figured that it would be in bad taste to go out of the stall to get redressed in the event I happened to be standing there naked and some little bastard kid walked in. At that point, I had only made a mess; I had not yet committed a felony and intended to keep it that way.When I finished getting dressed, I picked up the hose and cleaned up the entire stall, washing down the remains toward the drain in the center of the room. I put down the hose and walked out of the bathroom. I had intended to go to the manager and thank him for all he had done, but when I walked out, three of the management staff were there to greet me with a standing ovation. I started laughing so hard that I thought I was going to throw up again, but managed to scurry out to the car where my wife was now waiting to pick me up by the front door. The upshot of all this is that I strongly recommend eating dinner at Ryan's Steak House.	They have, by far, the nicest management staff of any restaurant in which I have eaten.

One night, after a particularly long day of work, the cowboys start to gripe about their dinner. The cowboys say to the chef can't you cook anything else? We eat the same crap every day! Oh my exclaims the chef. I thought you guys loved eating the same thing. I'll come up with a new recipe for tomorrow night.The next night the cowboys come back to a newly prepared meal from the chef, so they sit down and start digging in. The cowboys tear through the meal like it's the best food they've ever had. They all nod in agreement at how delicious this new dish is, until one cowboy looks out the window and realizes the yard is empty and there are no goats to be seen.

The scariest and most feared whale in the entire ocean had his son kidnapped by krill... (an original joke) The scariest and most feared whale in the entire ocean had his son kidnapped by krill, in a guerilla act of revenge for all of the family they'd lost over the years. They snuck up one night, and in their masses, surrounded the sleeping calf, and swam away, carrying him miles away from his father. Safe to say, when the whale awoke, he was distraught. He swam and swam, searching everywhere, but to no avail. 'WHERE IS MY SON' he bellowed, disturbing fish everywhere. This distress caught the attention of a wise old sea turtle. 'I saw your son', said the turtle swimming over to the whale, 'he was kidnapped by krill. I think I can take you to him'Grateful, the whale accepted this offer, and the pair set out, searching hastily. After many hours of fruitless looking, they came to a large white cloud, and they came to a stop. The turtle looked sombre. 'I have bad news', he said mournfully. 'The krill have used their surprisingly adequate war skills once again. They have lactated so much, that they have created this giant, impenetrable white cloud. It's so wide, so high, so thick. I'm so sorry, but it's over. 'The whale would not accept this. 'I'll swim through it! He said''No', returned the turtle. The milk is bizarrely poisonous for whales. 'Okay then, we'll wait for it to disperse, then we can go after them again! ', the wale countered'It will take days!' cried the turtle. The cloud is miles wide, and miles thick. There's no hope. 'Alright then, can't I go over it, can't I even look over it? ', the whale nearly sobbed in desperation.The turtle looked him dead in the eye. 'You don't understand.	There's no use spying over krill milk'

Young King Arthur.  was ambushed and imprisoned by the monarch of a neighboring kingdom. The monarch could have killed him but was moved by Arthur's youth and ideals. So, the monarch offered him his freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult question. Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer and, if after a year, he still had no answer, he would be put to death. The question?....What do women really want? Such a question would   perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and to young Arthur, it seemed an   impossible query. But, since it was better than death, he accepted the monarch's proposition to have an answer by year's end. He returned to his kingdom and began to poll everyone: the princess, the priests, the wise men and even the court jester. He spoke with everyone, but no one could give him a satisfactory answer. Many people advised him to consult the old witch, for only she would have the answer.But the price would be high; as the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged. The last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no choice but to talk to the witch. She agreed to answer the question, but he would have to agree to her price first . The old witch wanted to marry Sir Lancelot, the most noble of the Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend!Young Arthur was horrified. She was hunchbacked and hideous, had only one tooth, smelled like sewage, made obscene noises, etc. He had never encountered such a repugnant creature in all his life. He refused to force his friend to marry her and endure such a terrible burden; but Lancelot, learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur. He said nothing was too big of a sacrifice compared to Arthur's life and the preservation of the Round Table. Hence, a wedding was proclaimed and the witch answered Arthur's question thus:What a woman really wants, she answered....is to be in charge of her own life.Everyone in the kingdom instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and that Arthur's life would be spared. And so it was,   the neighboring monarch granted Arthur his freedom and Lancelot and the witch had a wonderful wedding. The honeymoon hour approached and Lancelot, steeling himself for a horrific experience, entered the bedroom. But, what a sight awaited him. The most beautiful woman he had ever seen lay before him on the bed. The astounded Lancelot asked what had happened . The beauty replied that since he had been so kind to her when she appeared as a witch, she would henceforth, be her horrible deformed self only half the time and the beautiful maiden the other half.Which would he prefer? Beautiful during the day....or night? Lancelot pondered the predicament. During the day, a beautiful woman to show off to his friends, but at night, in the privacy of his castle, an old witch ? Or, would he prefer having a hideous witch during the day, but by night, a beautiful woman for him to enjoy wondrous intimate moments? What would YOU do?What Lancelot chose is below. BUT.....make YOUR choice before   you scroll down below. OKAY? Noble Lancelot said that he would allow HER to make the choice herself. Upon hearing this, she announced that she would be beautiful all the time because he had respected her enough to let her be in charge of her own life.

A worker was on a billboard. He was putting up a new ad for the restaurant below it. This restaurant had come up with a clever new ad campaign and the worker was proud to be a part of it.However, people started yelling at the worker from the ground, complaining that he was doing the restaurant a disservice with the ad he was placing up. He couldn't figure out why. Maybe there was something offensive about the ad that someone didn't catch beforehand, and here it was displayed on a giant billboard for all passersby to see.Later, the worker met up with the manager of the restaurant and told him about the dilemma. I think you might have made something a little more offensive than you intended, he said. Nonsense, replied the manager. The ad campaign has been test-run by executives, and every single one of them has given us the green light.So why were there so many people complaining about the ad while I was putting it up? asked the worker.Oh, that's natural, the manager answered.

What are you doing here? !Oh, I was just taking a light stroll, the man remarks casually.Didn't you read the sign outside? The farmer asks, his temper slowly rising.Eh? There was a sign? I must've missed it, the man replies, shrugging it off.Well, my good friend, the farmer says, his eye slightly twitching. Let me tell you what that sign says. It says you're not allowed in here!It does? The man murmurs.Of course it does, you bloody scoundrel! Let me spell it out for you. No. Tres. Pas. Sing, the farmer says, emphasising every syllable of the word. Do you understand what that means? !Ohhh, now it makes sense, the man replies happily, nodding.Now will you leave already? The farmer shouts, fed up with the man.But sir, there shouldn't be a problem here. I should be allowed inside here just fine, the man protests.And why should you? The farmer questions sternly.It's quite simple, sir! The man clarifies.	You said that the sign said 'No Trespa Singh', but I'm actually Jaswant Singh!

Several years ago, Andy was sentenced to prison. During his stay, he got along well with the guards and all his fellow inmates…. 	The warden saw that deep down, Andy was a good person and made arrangements for Andy to learn a trade while doing his time.After three years, Andy was recognized as one of the best carpenters in the local area.Often he would be given a weekend pass to do odd jobs for the citizens of the community and he always reported back to prison before Sunday night was over.The warden was thinking of remodeling his kitchen and in fact had done much of the work himself.But he lacked the skills to build a set of kitchen cupboards and a large counter top, which he had promised his wife.So he called Andy into his office and asked him to complete the job for him.But, alas, Andy refused.He told the warden, Gosh, I'd really like to help you but counter fitting is what got me into prison in the first place.

A woman goes to a fortune teller. Can you read people's futures? asked the woman.Of course dear, said the old fortune teller peering into her crystal ball, I have predicted many events and have given people their futures accurately. Now, what would you like to know?The woman was hesitant and doubtful but asked nonetheless, What does my future look like?The fortune teller nodded and peered into her crystal ball. It lit up with various colors and different intensities of light then by the end, sudden darkness. Her expression all the while changed from surprise to fascination to sadness. This made the woman anxious to say the least.So? What did it you see?Well, right now you have two paths you may take. One good and one bad.What are they specifically?The bad path puts you on a lonesome road. It is filled with sadness and you will soon fade from the minds of many people. You will not be recognized nor will you garner any riches, be it gold and other riches.And the good?The good path will make you great and well known among many. You will be ahead of everyone else and the numbers will flow to you, they will be on your side. But... The fortune teller stops and peers back into the crystal ball which flickered.But what? It already sounds great, I'd choose that in a heartbeat, so what more is there?

The church in my town fell on hard times recently... There wasn't hardly enough money coming in to keep the lights on. So, with the approval of the priests, the friars began selling flowers from the Church's magnificent garden. They were a hit, and soon the flower money was rolling in in droves. A few days after they start, however, Tony, the local florist comes to the church in a huff.Please, he begs of the friars, you must stop selling flowers! Everyone wants to buy flowers from the men of God, so nobody comes to my business! I'll be ruined if you keep this up.We're sorry, the friars tell him, but the doors of Hod's temple must remain open, and for that we need money. Tony leaves the church, even more upset.He goes to his neighbors asking if they'll help him boycott, but they're all too afraid to speak out. lawyer, seeing if he can solve this legally, but the lawyer won't dare try and sue the church. He even goed to the governor, but he gets told Church isn't doing anything wrong.The week rolls by, and the Friars grow more successful as Tony gets closer to broke. Finally, in desperation, he hires the meanest, baddest, most nasty man in town, Hue, and sends him after the Friars.Hue scares all the firars, smashes all their tables, rips up the garden beds, and even pisses all over the remaining flowers. The next day, the Friars are no longer selling flowers, and Tony is back in business.	In the end, it seems the saying is true:Hue and only Hue can prevent florist friars.

[OC] Two police officers are talking about what they think was the most expensive crime/robbery in history. The first officer talks for a few minutes about a bank robber who stole millions of dollars, and had over 50 heists, which he did single handedly, and has still never been caught to this day.The second officer however, has a much more interesting tale.His name was Jack Richy Briggs. He was known for having incredibly convoluted heists, that often involved very expensive equipment. Perhaps one of the most notorious bank robbers from the wild west. After years of evading the authorities, and making ridiculous amounts of money, he finally makes his most explosive and expensive heist yet.Oh really? What did he do?Well, he bought hundreds of pounds of dynamite, and transported it all using hundreds of grunts-for-hire to help him carry it all the way to the bank. For this heist, he was gonna hit the biggest, most reinforced vault, of all of the south. All in one night, he managed to set all of the dynamite, and he set off the dynamite, but guess what happened?What happened?He blew up the whole place! There was nothing left of the vault or money!No way, that has to be the most expensive bank heist I’ve ever heard of!Yeah, he really broke the bank with that stuntGod this joke is awful.

The Three-Legged Pig. An insurance salesman decides to make one last cold call on his country route and winds up way in the back country at the end of a dirt road. He drives up to the farm, gets out of the car with his briefcase, and walks up to the door. On his way, he glances at the fenced in area attached to the barn where he sees a large hog staring at him. He does a classic double-take as it registers on him that this pig only has 3 legs.He knocks on the door and an old farmer in overalls answers. Howdy, sir, I'm working with United Insurance and I'm here---well doggone it, I just gotta ask you first:  I noticed your pig only has three legs. What's the story?The farmer spits and say, Well, you see, a few years back my wife left the stove on at night. The flame caught a greasy napkin and while we were sleeping the kitchen caught fire and the house filled with smoke. Of course, we never would have known that except for that pig. That pig must've smelled the smoke, hopped the fence, busted into the house and damned if he didn't drag me, the missus, my youngest son, and the cat out of our beds and onto the front lawn. Firemen showed up and doused it before the whole house went up but that pig saved our lives.And that's how he lost his leg? Saving you?Nah, that wasn't it. See about a year ago--this is about a year after the fire--a couple desperate fellas broke out of prison and stole a car. The cops were hot on their tail but these two lost 'em and headed out as far into the sticks as they could. They pulled up here at the farm. These two tied us all up, grabbed all our money and belongings and were arguing about how to kill us when that pig busts right through the barn door, launches himself at the first con knocking him out. He grabbed the guy's gun in his mouth, aimed it at the second one and darned if he didn't stare that second one down so bad he dropped his gun and surrendered to the pig. The pig frees us and we called the cops who hauled them both back to jail.So the pig--he lost his leg in the tussle?Naw, not then. No, about six months ago--about April--we were doing our taxes. We'd had a couple bad years with crops and such and we just couldn't see how we could avoid losing the place. We were in a terrible place. Now that pig, somehow he gets into the office in the barn, sees all the forms and paperwork. He stayed up all night while were asleep, crunching numbers, shifting figures from one place to the next, discovering a few little pockets of savings we forgot about. Well, I tell you, I was astounded.	There on the desk was my tax form and not only were the finances in good enough shape to keep the farm, we got a tidy little return to boot.Ok, that's great, but how in the hell did the pig lose his leg doing that?Oh, it's like this, mister:  A pig like that you don't eat all at once.

Moshe ignores this advice, grabs his camera as as he's about to take a picture, one of the bears grabs the tour guide and eats him whole. Moshe hightails it out of there and after what seemed to be hours of running, he comes across the forest ranger. He tells the ranger the story and the ranger asks Moshe to lead him to the spot.

A frog walks into a bank and approaches the teller. He sees from her nametag that the woman working at the counter is named 'Patricia Wack'. Hello Patricia. the frog says politely. I'm here today because I'd like to borrow $200,000 Patricia does a double-take, and looks at the frog incredulously. You, a frog, want to take out such a large loan? I'm afraid there's no way I can approve that. Patricia replies. Yes, I know. answers the frog, apparently expecting this response. But I know the bank manager. Believe me, it'll be ok. Besides, I can provide this as collateral. The frog reaches into his pocket and retrieves an small but immaculately carved marble elephant, and places it onto the counter. Patricia, dumbfounded, picks up the elephant and retreats into the bank's back office to consult with her manager. I've just had the oddest exchange. Patricia explains to her manager when she finds him. A frog is waiting out there in the bank, wanting to take out a $200,000 loan. He claims that you know him, and will approve it. Ah, yes. replies the manager knowingly. A most remarkable young chap. Though he doesn't look it, he's actually the son of Mick Jagger, feel free to approve the loan. Patricia holds up her finger. But sir she insists. You haven't heard the strangest part. He wants to provide *\**this\* as collateral. she places the frog's marble elephant on her manager's desk. I mean. she laughs. What even \*is\* this? Patricia's manager looks her dead in the eye. It's a knick knack Patty Wack, give the frog a loan, his old man is a rolling stone.

Pedro and Juan are stranded in the desert... (My favourite joke, [LONG]) After a day of walking, staggering, then crawling, they are thirsty, starving, and near death. They are about to give up when Juan exclaims, Pedro, look! At thee bottom of the dune... it’s an Oasis!Pedro struggles to bring his head up to look. Juan... I think so my friend. I think so...

No my friend, hold on until your last breath, i will venture down, and see if it is real. This Oasis will save us!Pedro limply nods, and slumps to the hot sand, as Juan, finding some last reserve of energy sprawls down the sand dune towards salvation. After a few minutes, he has reached his destination. He yells out to his friend, elated.Pedro, it’s so beautiful! There is water! A clear pool of the clearest water I have ever seen! And... Oh my God Pedro, there is a beautiful tree!A tree?, croaks Pedro from atop the ridge.But this is no normal tree!, exclaims Juan, It is  bestowed with the most glorious array of porks! gammons, roast hams! My God Pedro! It’s incredible! It’s a BACON TREE!Pedro tears up, elated that he and his friend may get to continue their lives. It’s a miracle Juan! A miracle from God himself! Please my friend, I do not have an ounce of energy left, please bring me some bacon from this glorious Bacon Tree!Of course Pedro, of course! Yells Juan with glee. He stands upright, spurred on by the miracle before him, and reaches out, eyeing the most succulent morsel from the Bacon Tree.In an instant, the moment he touches it, a multitude of sub-machine-guns emerge from the branches  - and Juan is annihilated by a hail of gunfire to the chest.He slumps to the floor, gargling, dying...Juan! What the fuck happened!? Yells Pedro.Pedro, do not come any closer...! Gargles Juan through his shattered esophagus.	This is no Bacon Tree... It’s a Ham-Bush!

The Casket. One day i was walking home from work when all of a sudden i hear 'bang bang bang' behind me. I turned around to see what is making the noise an i see nothing.

I turn around once more and i see a huge casket, ones you use for bodies during burials, just hopping towards me on the street! I stat to run and that is when i realised, its chasing me. I turn to knock at a nearby house for help, no answer. I see the casket getting closer and closer so i do what anyone would do,  break the door open.

It is trying to break the door down, i retreat to the stairs of the house as i watch to see if it will get in. But then silence, i wonder 'is it gone' however suddenly it crashes through the door! I run up the stairs, watching as it is following me still! I lock myself in the bathroom, i realise i have cornered myself. The casket starts to pound against the door, it was then that i realised i must fight back. So i gather all the items in the bathroom, i grab the toothbrushes to use as little swords against the casket, i empty out the medicine cabinet at my feet to use as throwing weapons. It was at this moment that the banging stopped again, 10 seconds went by, i began to think it had gone away! However, suddenly it bursts through the door! I throw the toothbrushes at it, no good. I throw toilet roll in hopes to trip it up, no good.	I look down in panic hoping to find one last hope, when suddenly i spot the cough syrup.I pick the cough syrup, and i throw it at the casket, and yanno what happened?The coffin stopped.im sorry

Game Show.  Some folks see me as a know-it-all. I'm not, but I have a reasonable memory, and it got me on a game show, once.The television game show was being recorded - they do a whole week at a time, and this was the wrap-up. I was in the hot seat for the last big question.The host turned to me, and read the question slowly and carefully. But I didn't know the answer!Fortunately, I had a backup plan (there was no way I was missing out on this million bucks!). I haven't figured out how to do the fingers-in-the-mouth bit, but still manage to make a pretty piercing whistle. From the back of the stage, four mounted knights-in-armor appeared, waving their lances threateningly at the show's host. Little did I know HIS hidden talents...The host looked scared for a moment, and then a steely look came over him. He leapt into the air, and karate kicked the first knight onto the floor. He picked up the lance from the stricken knight, and fought off the second, who also fell sprawling on the floor. The second knight's horse shied, and bolted, colliding with the third knight in the process.The game show host was just beginning to enjoy himself now.

Marcelino was a newbie, and Santiago's been in the force for years.As they go about their business, Santiago sees an old man pass by.Good evening, Mr. Lopez.Ah, good evening to you too. Santiago.Marcelino smiled at the pleasant exchange, but was then asked by Santiago:What time is it?It's 5:30 pm.Good to know.Marcelino then watched in horror as Santiago pulled out his gun, and shot Mr. Lopez repeatedly, obviously killing him.Whoa! What the hell was that?! It's still early!Shut up, Marcelino. I know where the old bastard lives.	He's not gonna make it.

St this point the man is practically leaping with excitement for he could finally see what made the indescribably sound. The man recounts the sand and the grass for the monk and the monk grants him entry. The man is lead by the monk deep into the temple until they stopped at a massive door. The door was decorated with gold and was the most beautiful thing the man had seen. The monk unlocks the door and the man enters the room only to find an even bigger door plated with Jade. This goes on for several more doors, each plated with valuable materials and decorated with beautifully carved symbols. Finally, the monk and the man reach the final door. The door is at least 25 feet high and every inch of it is covered in every valuable metal the man had seen thus far. To open the final door... you must meditate here in the darkness for 3 months with no food or water. The monk said. After the man had sat down in front of the giant door he began to meditate and the monk left him to himself.

The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says : Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.

Professional gamer longs to impress girlfriend with his skills. The gamer began by explaining that being THE BEST at any given video game is a tremendously difficult feat. While the disparity between the average gamer and the very best gamer is lost on the layperson, he assured her that the gap was incredibly vast. The average viewer lacks the capacity to perceive this difference in skill, and indeed, part of being so damn good at what you do is making it look easy and seamless. Honing your craft requires years of dedication, sacrifice, discipline, repetition, strategic ingenuity, clever thinking...in short, you practically have to live and breathe video games. The gamer explained how he had sacrificed multiple friendships in pursuit of this single-minded goal to be the best. He even personally designed practice routines and finger training exercises for whatever he struggled with on a particular day, whether it be reaction speed, accuracy of input sequences, precision of movement, etc. At night, he would dream of simulated scenarios that may occur in his games and appropriately respond to them, effectively practicing while sleeping. It was an all-consuming path and his brain was an engine that kept running.He claimed that he used to think he was great at video games because he was the best in his neighborhood, and then the best in his circle of friends, but that with the advent of the internet and online games, he quickly realized that his skills were far from the best. He began to study the play of the REAL best gamers who time and time again would prove their mettle on the world stage, bringing home championship after championship. He wasn't delusional enough to continue thinking he was the best, but he was convinced that with enough practice, that could be him one day.At this point the girl was rather impressed. That's so funny, I never thought of it that way, but I guess you're right. It's just like being good at anything else really. It takes a lot of practice, smart thinking, fast fingers... I've watched a little League of Legends and I think it was called... CS Gold? CS GO he corrected her. Come on over to my house and I'll show you what it takes to be great.So she followed him to his house, in part excited to see just how good her boyfriend was, but mostly just happy to support him for something he was passionate about. They arrived at his room. He turned on his Xbox. The girl laughed hysterically and left, never to be heard from again. The girl's name?	pcmasterrace

Let's have a look at that cock.I take it out and she looks at it closely. She brings a ruler and takes some measurements. She nods and shouts into the back room, I need a pack of S-5 condoms over here!But when she turned to look at me again, she saw my penis had grown some. She started measuring it again, and shouted, Never mind, get me the S-7!Again she turned to look at me and she noticed that my penis had grown even more. She made more measurements, lifting the penis and carefully noting the diameter, the length, the girth, etc. She shouted, No, better bring the S-10!And yet again she turned to me and saw my fully erect penis. She sighed and set to measuring again, getting the measurements as accurately as she could.While she did this, her assistant came out of the back room, carrying 3 different boxes of condoms.	Here you go, ma'am.Groaning, the pharmacist turns around and says, Oh forget all that, just bring me a box of tissues.

Once upon a time in a village, a man appeared and announced to the villagers that he would buy monkeys for $10 each... The villagers, seeing that there were many monkeys around, went out to the forest and started catching them.The man bought thousands at $10 and as supply started to diminish, the villagers stopped their effort. He further announced that he would now buy at $20. This renewed the efforts of the villagers and they started catching monkeys again.Soon the supply diminished even further and people started going back to their farms. The offer increased to $25 each and the supply of monkeys became so little that it was an effort to even see a monkey, let alone catch it!The man now announced that he would buy monkeys at $50! However, since he had to go to the city on some business, his assistant would now buy on behalf of him.In the absence of the man, the assistant told the villagers; Look at all these monkeys in the big cage that the man has collected.	I will sell them to you at $35 and when the man returns from the city, you can sell them to him for $50 each.The villagers rounded up with all their savings and bought all the monkeys.They never saw the man nor his assistant, only monkeys everywhere!

A handsome priest and a young nun are traveling when their car breaks down... And they are forced to spend the night in a motel - with only one room left.The priest, being a gentleman, said, Due to the circumstances, let's just share the room. I'll sleep on the floor, you can have the bed. I'm sure God will understand.The nun agrees and they turn off the lights to sleep.Halfway through the night, the nun who has always had the hots for the priests gets frisky and suddenly has an idea.Father, it's very cold. Could you help me...? I'm sure God will understand...Hearing this, the priest gets up from the floor, gets a blanket and gives it to her.Irritated but determined to succeed, she tries again after a few minutes.Father, I'm still cold! Could you *please* help me...?

One day, the emperor decided he wanted to find the best samurai in the world. So he sent his men around the world, and they came back with three potential options: a Japanese samurai, a Chinese samurai and a Jewish samurai.The emperor held tryouts to see which was best. First, he brought in the Japanese samurai. As the Japanese samurai strode into the great Hall and approached him, the emperor pulled out a box and opened it, and from it flew out a single fruit fly. Without hesitation, the Japanese samurai whips out his sword, shouts his battle cry and cuts the fly into two perfect halves.

Theory vs Reality. This is a long joke and if it's been posted before, sorry in advance. Twenty-five years ago a movie came out called Indecent Proposal. It was about a wealthy older man who offered $1 million to sleep with another man's wife. The older man in the movie was Robert Redford, a very famous and handsome man, so it was not really a tough choice to make. The joke starts off with a son asking his father what's the difference between theory and reality. The father says, go ask your Mother if she would sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million. So the son asks his mother. She thinks about it for a few seconds and says, YES! of course I'd sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million. So the boy goes back to his Father and says, Mom would would sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million. Then the Father tells his son to ask his sister if she would sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million. So the son asks his sister if she would sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million. She too thinks about it for a few seconds. Well he is old but he is still handsome and famous. $1 million, is a lot of money. Yes, I'd sleep with him for $1 million. So the boy returns to his Father and says Yes, sis would sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million. But what has this got to do with answering my initial question? The Father replies Well son, in theory, we are millionaires.	But in reality, we are living with two whores.

A rich man threw a mansion party. It was of extravagant proportions. Hundreds of guests filled his enormous abode to mingle and drink with glee. During the festivities the rich man gathered everyone to the backyard.Come! I have something to show you all! As well as a challenge!His curious (also drunk) flock followed him out to what appeared to be a huge swimming pool filled with live alligators.What is the meaning of this?! Exclaimed one manThe rich man replied. I have so much wealth that I do not know what to do with it. I have more money than one man could ever hope to spend. Alas I am bored!This is my 80 foot pool and it holds one hundred hungry alligators! He proudly proclaimed.I am prepared to pay a cash prize of $10,000,000 to anyone who can swim from one side to the other without being harmed!His audience fell silent. No one was crazy (or drunk enough) to attempt such a feat.You’re a madman! One guest bellowed out.A fools errand to be sure! Another one shoutedYes, yes, I suppose you’re right. The rich man nodded. I did not expect anyone to be willing to throw away their life for mere dollars. Back inside I supposeJust as the rich man and all of his guests are heading back inside the mansion, he hears a loud SPLASH.Out of my way! He yelled, as he pushed his way through the crowd back to the pool.Much to his surprise and disbelief, he sees a young man swimming for his life across the gator infested pool! The young man narrowly makes it to the other side safe and unharmed, climbs out of the water, doubles over hands on knees and begins to breath heavily. The rich man rushes over to him.Are you insane?! He shrieks.You could have died! Why would you even attempt such a stunt?! I mean the money is no problem, I’ll deliver it to you at once however, I must know what made you go for it?	I’ve never seen anyone swim that fast in my life!The young man, still catching his breath, picks himself up to stand straight, wrings his soaked shirt, and slicks his hair back, looks the rich man dead in his face and angrily says....Who the fuck pushed me!

A married woman is walking through a desert cave one day when she comes across a magical genie lamp. She rubs the lamp, and a genie comes out. Thank you for getting me out of that cursed lamp! I... I was so crowded in there. Listen, to make it up to you, I'll give you three wishes. The woman is overjoyed. She jumps up and down excitedly, but then the genie speaks again.However, I mush abide by the rules set for me by my creators. Everything I grant you, I grant tenfold to your husband.Now, the woman hated her husband, but she figured she might as well have a little fun, even if her husband gets better. My first wish, my dear genie, is to be the richest woman alive. The genie snaps his fingers, and it is so.He speaks, You do realize that your husband has been given tenfold of what you have received, yes? She responds, Yes, but he and I are one. What's mine is his and what's his is mine.She ponders over her second wish, then decides. I wish to be the most beautiful woman alive, she says. The genie snaps his fingers and it is so, but the husband becomes 10x as handsome as she is pretty. The genie asks,  Your husband is now far more attractive than you'll ever be, does that not concern you? No, she responds, for I am the prettiest woman alive; he will only have eyes for me.Then, she had an idea. An evil, cunning idea, and a dark smile curled her lips. She looked at the genie, and said, I wish for a mild heart attack, thinking she could kill her husband and take all that is his. **Her husband received a heart attack 10x as mild as hers.	**

Watching Childbith. The nurse approached him, smiling. The labor is going great, she said.

Wouldn't you like to at least come in and see her?The man seemed to hesitate slightly, then shook his head again, No, no, I couldn't do that.He jingled car keys in his sweaty palm and resumed his pacing.The nurse went back into the room and coached Mom's valiant efforts in pushing the baby into the world.As the baby's head began to exit the birth canal, the nurse raced to the hall, grabbed the man by his elbow, and dragged him to the bedside saying, You have got to see this!At that very moment, the baby boy was born and placed on the tummy of the mother whose radiant smile shone through her tears.The man began to cry openly. Turning to the nurse, he sobbed, You were right! This is the greatest moment in my life!By now, the nurse, too, was tearful. She put her arm around him, and he rested his head on her shoulder. She soothed, No one should miss the birth of their son.This isn't my son, the man blubbered. This isn't even my wife. I've never seen her before in my life.

A magician was working on a cruise. A magician was working on a cruise ship in the Caribbean. The audience would be different each week, so the magician allowed himself to do the same tricks over and over again. There was only one problem: The captain's parrot saw the shows each week and began to understand how the magician did every trick. Once he understood he started shouting in the middle of the show: Look, it's not the same hat Look, he is hiding the flowers under the table Hey, why are all the cards the Ace of Spades ? The magician was furious but couldn't do anything; it was, after all, the captain's parrot. One day the ship had an accident and sank. The magician found himself on a piece of wood in the middle of the ocean with the parrot, of course. They stared at each other with hate, but did not utter a word. This went on for a day and another and another. After a week the parrot said: OK, I give up.	Where's the boat?
An American and Japanese team decided to engage in a competitive boat race. Both teams practiced hard and long to reach their peak performance.On the big day they felt ready. The Japanese won by a mile. Afterward, the American team was discouraged by the loss. Morale sagged. Corporate management decided that the reason for the crushing defeat had to be found, so a consulting firm was hired to investigate the problem and recommended corrective action.The consultant's finding: The Japanese team had eight people rowing and one person steering; the American team had one person rowing and eight people steering.After a year of study and millions spent analyzing the problem, the consultant firm concluded that too many people were steering and not enough were rowing on the American team.So as race day neared again the following year, the American team's management structure was completely reorganized. The new structure: four steering managers, three area steering managers and a new performance review system for the person rowing the boat to provide work incentive.The next year, the Japanese won by two miles.	Humiliated, the American corporation laid off the rower for poor performance and gave the managers a bonus for discovering the problem.

[Shaggy dog] Beatles karaoke (OC!) One night at karaoke, a man goes to the mic and tries his hand at a soulfelt version of Yesterday by The Beatles, but does such a terrible job that he is booed off the stage. Deeply demoralized, he orders a pint at the bar as tears of shame well up in his eyes.Another patron notices this man, approaches, places a warm hand on his shoulder, and says, I think you've captured the spirit of the song perfectly. John would be quite proud.Eyes widening, the singer looks at his guest, P-- Paul McCartney?!?! ?Paul smiles and nods. Shh. Now... it's not often that I see such a loving tribute to my band's music, so I tell you what I'm going to do. When we became more famous than Jesus, let's just say that we acquired a few divine powers. I am going to give you the ability to absolutely crush any Beatles song that you perform in public from here on out, provided you have a pint in your hand and drink a toast to me beforehand.Incredulous, the guy watches as Paul waves his hand and magicky sparks fly out. With a burst of confidence, he toasts Paul and gets back up on the stage, pint in hand. The crowd recognizes him and starts to boo, but as he launches into Norwegian Wood, the crowd is mezmerized by the utter beauty of the performance. Thunderous applause follows. He follows up with another toast to Paul and a performance of Revolution, which leaves the crowd absolutely PUMPED! Victorious, he goes home for the night.Days later, he tries his luck again at a different pub. He orders a pint, toasts Paul (wherever he may be), launches into a performance of While My Guitar Gently Weeps at the mic, and the crowd can't get enough of it, going absolutely crazy.Before long, he has achieved a certain degree of fame for this talent of his. He makes his way onto a televised talent show. As he is nervously waiting behind stage, he realizes... he doesn't have his pint! The man calls a stagehand over and aggressively says, Beer! I need beer! There's beer in the green room, right?Uhhh... not beer, sir, the stagehand says, a bit frightened. But we do have booze.Damn! What kinds of booze do you have?I can make you a margarita, a vodka and Red Bull, or a rum and coke.Hrm... make me the vodka and Red Bull. And hurry!It's his turn to go on stage. Nervously, he toasts Paul with his mixed drink and goes on stage to sing Eleanor Rigby. However, the wrong words come out. He starts crooning, Someone's knockin' at the door. Somebody's ringin' the bell...The music stops awkwardly and he starts over. Again, the wrong words come out. When you were young, and your life was an open book...The crowd starts to boo. Frantically, the man looks around and lo and behold - he sees Paul McCartney sitting in the audience! Paul! You've got to help me!!! What went wrong?!? !Paul shakes his head and points at the drink.	Red Bull gives you Wings.

Stanley was killed in a freak explosion in his garage... There was nothing Stanley liked better than drinking beer, smoking cigarettes, and hunting. At least twice a week, Stanley went out in the woods with his hunting buddies Cletus and Jimmy. They never shot much, but they always had a few cases handy and always had a good time. They were practically inseparable and were often seen bumbling around town together.Now, one day Stanley was working out in the shed when his lit cigarette ignited a nearby gas can. The can exploded, Stanley was engulfed in flames and, tragically, died from his injuries. After the police investigation ruled the explosion an accident, his mangled body was sent to the morgue. The entire front side of his body was burned beyond recognition, but everyone in town knew that if anybody could confirm it was Stanley, it'd be Cletus and Jimmy.The mortician called Cletus in to identify the body. Thank you for coming in, Cletus, she said gently. I know this isn't easy for you and I appreciate you taking the time. Cletus replied in a somber tone. No trouble at all, ma'am. The mortician lifted the sheet from the body, revealing Stanley's horribly burned frontside. She asked Cletus if this was indeed Stanley.Weeeeeeeell, said Cletus. I don't know. I really can't tell. Why don't you flip him on over? The mortician was confused, but obliged, revealing Stanley's relatively unharmed naked backside. Without hesitation, Cletus exclaimed, Nope, that ain't Stanley! The mortician was surprised, but thanked Cletus again for his time and sent him on his way.She then called Jimmy to the morgue to see if he could provide a positive identification. As with Cletus, she offered her sympathies and thanked him for coming in. Then she pulled back the sheet and asked Jimmy if he could confirm it was Stanley.Weeeeeeell, Jimmy said pensively. Hard to say. Would it be alright if you flip him over? The mortician was even more surprised this time, but again obliged. After only a second, Jimmy said confidently, Nope, that ain't Stanley. The mortician was dumbfounded.I have to ask, she said. Why on earth did you want me to flip the body over? Cletus said the exact same thing!Jimmy replied, Well you see miss, this man's only got one asshole.One asshole?! the mortician cried. What's that got to do with anything?	!Weeeeell you see, said Jimmy, Whenever me and Cletus and Stanley walked through town, everybody would point and say, 'There goes Stanley with them two assholes!'

A drunk man borrows and loses his partner's prosthetic leg in a game of roulette in Las Vegas while she's asleep in their room. When she wakes up in the morning she is furious and sends him down to the tables to win it back... ..the man, now sober, is absolutely determined to make up for his sordid late night misdeed, and immediately challenges the casino to win back the prosthetic leg.For the whole next day he is at the table, losing pile after pile of chips, thousands and thousands of dollars at a time. Soon, a small crowd is gathered round him, watching, as this intense game goes on and on. One observer taps the man on the shoulder and he turns irritably.How long are you going to do this? The observer asks.As long as it takes to win back this leg. The man responds shortly.Pausing only to relieve himself in a bucket provided by the casino, the man continues to play for the leg through the night and into the next day. Money seems to be no issue for him, he never sleeps and he never seems to tire either.Now a huge crowd is gathered around him as he reaches the end of his first week trying to win back the leg. No-one can believe how much this man wants to make up for his transgression. People begin to praise the man on social media. The casino manager makes his way through the crowd on the floor to approach the man, who does not take lightly to being interrupted in his so far frivolous pursuit.How long are you going to do this? The manager asks.As long as it takes to win back this leg. The man responds, barely looking away from the table.A month passes and still sadly unsuccessful, the man does not waiver in his efforts to win back the leg. Now the casino is the biggest attraction in Las Vegas. People pay just to watch the man relentlessly and seemingly without fatigue play over and over again, despite the overwhelming bad-luck he is experiencing. The man's mother is cleared to approach the man.How long are you going to do this? His mother asks.As long as it takes to win back this leg! The man responds, barely looking away from the table. Six months pass and the man is STILL at the table, he is being fed through a tube and has a catheter installed along with an adult diaper, so now even his ablutions do not hamper his attempts to win back the leg.A TV crew finally breaks through the crowd which by now stretches out the edges of the Las Vegas strip. The reporter excitedly gets a microphone into the man's face.How long are you going to do this? The reporter asks.Look I've told you! The man roars.	I'm going to do this for the rest of my wife!

There was a new movie in town that everyone was talking about. Since their first debut, Best E. Studios has released works of art to massive acclaim. With the upcoming release, everyone was understandably excited. On premiere night, everyone lined up at the theater for the first viewing. The namesake of the studio and director of the film, Edna, even made an appearance, much to the elation of fans. And so with belated breath, the film began to roll.A countdown appeared on screen, and then black fades into bright white. The audience loudly cheers and claps. The screen remains white. The audience's excitement calms down, anxious with what could be coming.Several minutes pass, nothing changes. Some members of the audience begin to express discontent.What's going on? Is there a problem?Luckily with the director in the room watching along, he could soothe their fears.Do not worry my friends, this is all a part of the experience!And so with reassurance by the film's creator, the audience settled down and focused their attention on the screen in anticipation. Several more minutes passed. People were starting to get uncomfortable. Nothing was playing, and the projector had been making strange noises within a few minutes of this white screen. Just when people were getting ready to leave, they saw movement.A small black speck on the white screen began to move erratically. There was confusion and hushed whispers. What's happening? Is this a part of the movie? They all watched with rapt attention as this small fleck bounced around, leaving and coming back from all angles.Finally an irate spectator yelled out:Oi, this ain't even the movie! That's just a goddamn fly buzzing around the screen!Clearly the projector had stopped working and the film wasn't playing. The crowd began to leave but in an attempt to save face, the director stood up once more.Friends please, do not leave, that fly isn't real, it's a part of the film!Angry with having wasted so much time and energy on this botched premiere, someone shouted outWhat on earth are you talking about? This was a failed release!	Besides, why would that fly be a part of the film?In reply, the director answered:Because dear friends, at Best Edna Studios, that is not just a bug, it is a feature!

A Christmas Myth. After learning about different ways to celebrate Christmas, the children were eager to learn more about the subject. Knowing that one of the teachers at their school was from the UK and maybe had an angel on top of the tree instead of the classic star, they went to ask him about it.It's a long story he said: It began a very, very long time ago. It was a cold and snowy day, as it usually is on the North Pole. December was almost halfway passed already, but still, no decoration were in place. The elves couldn't make time to decorate as they were busy making toys. And Father Christmas was in a very, very bad mood. So the Christmas angel figured he had to do something to cheer him up so Christmas would be joyful as always. Thus, he cleaned the workshop and the house, tossed out the old take away leftovers and went to look for the decorations. Approaching Father Christmas he asked:\-What should I do with these decorations? The angel asked.\-I don't care, leave me alone! Father Christmas hissed back.The angel figured he put up the decorations and give Father Christmas another day. Maybe the clean house and the decorations would cheer him up. And the next day the angel went to Father Christmas to ask about how he should organize the Christmas gifts on the sleigh. \-I don't care, leave me alone! Father Christmas hissed again. The angel, not admitting defeat just yet. He let another day pass and figured he should put up the Christmas tree while he were on it. Not entirely sure where to put it, as it never was in the same spot for two years in a row, he meekly approached Father Christmas, hoping he would be in a better mood as Christmas was very, very close.\-Where do you want the Tree? The angel asked.\-As far as I'm concerned ..., said Father Christmas.	You can take the tree and SHOVE IT UP YOUR...\-And that's the story of how the Christmas angel got on top of the Christmas tree.
The Talking Cat. A 2 bit magician had a show called Goldie, the Magic Talking Cat. He wasn't that skilled of a magician, so he had to make up for his lack of talent with cheesy 2 bit tricks. He found this cat that looked like it was clearly abandoned. It had fleas and ticks, wasn't fixed and it didn't have a collar. So he adopted the cat, cleaned it up and got the cat fixed. He gave him the name Goldie because of his golden orange  fur. So he had an idea on how to make money from his new pet. He was going to advertise his pet as a talking cat and take it to magic shows. The cat loved to meow all the time, so he thought he could make his money off of the cat's meows. The man showed off his talking cat at his show. He had his tip jar ready. After a few mundane magic tricks, the man pulled out the main attraction: The talking cat. He then asked the cat Hey Goldie, what's the name of one of China's former leaders?The cat said MaoThe crowd chuckled and thought it was cute. A few people tipped him. But they still wanted to see the cat speak. The man did a magic trick in front of the cat. The disappearing kitty treat. The cat then went Wow. See that? the man cried. That cat said wow!The crowd rolled their eyes. He got a few coins in his tip jar for the trick itself. The magician, sensing that the crowd would turn on him, got desperate. Hey Goldie, where does milk come fromThe cat then said CowThe crowd walked off and groaned.As the crowd walked off, the cat said Some cultures drink goat and sheep's milk. We just drink cow's milk in America due to cultural differences. Also, I would say the Wu Sangui was a former Chinese leader, but few Westerners know of his existence. And I didn't want to swear in front of the kids, so I said 'wow'  The tip jar is this way, folks.	Thanks for rescuing me, by the way, magic man!He walked into his carrier and then took a nap.

Businessman.  There was a businessman who was sure that his wife was cheating on him, so he put her under surveillance. One day at work, he got a call that told him to rush home quickly and he would be able to catch her in the act. So he rushed home to his 20th floor hi-rise apartment and burst into the room. His wife was there, but he didn’t see anyone else.Where is he? he shouted.Where is who? demanded his wife.Don’t play coy with me sugar. he said, and began to search the apartment.He looked in the bedroom; no one.He looked under the bed; no one.He looked in every closet; no one.Finally he heard a noise out on the balcony. He looked and saw a man hanging by his fingers from the balcony! Enraged, the man started stomping on his fingers. The man screamed, but stubbornly held on. Even more enraged, the business man went into the apartment and brought out a hammer. He then began hitting the man’s fingers and watched triumphantly as the man fell 20 stories. But to his dismay the man fell into a bush. Although badly injured, he wasn’t dead. The business man was livid! He went into his kitchen and rolled his refrigerator out to the balcony. He heaved it over the edge and watched with glee as the refrigerator landed on the injured man; killing him. The business man started to laugh, but mid-laugh grabbed his chest and died from a massive heart attack……..The business man found himself in line before the Pearly Gates. St. Peter was there and it was clear that there was a delay. St. Peter said,I’m sorry, but heaven is full today, we’re only letting in folks who have died in a very stressful way.Well I died today full of stress, said the business man.Really, said St. Peter, Do tell.So the business man related the above story. St. Peter was swayed.OK, he said, You can go in.The next guy in line stepped up. St. Peter told him the same thing.Did you die in a stressful way?Did I? And how!! replied the man. And he related the following story to St. Peter.I was doing my Jazzercise tape in my living room on the 21st floor of my hi-rise apartment when I kinda lost track of where I was. I accidentally fell off my balcony, and was plummeting to my sure death, when miraculously I was able to grab onto the balcony below mine. I was hanging on but just barely, when a man came out. Thank God I thought, I’m saved. But to my horror, he started stomping on my fingers. It hurt terribly, but I was able to hang on. Just when I thought I couldn’t take it anymore; he stopped and went back inside. Thank God I thought. But just then, he comes back out with a hammer and starts to hammer my fingers! Well I had to let go and I fell into a bush. Although badly injured, I was still alive, and I was just about to yell for help when I looked up just in time to see a refrigerator heading right for me…….And the next thing I know….I’m here.St. Peter’s mouth was hanging open.	All he could do was gesture the man inside.Go in, go on in, was all he could whisper.After a few moments to collect himself, St. Peter said, Next!The next guy steps up, and after being told the condition for entry, St. Peter asks,Did you die stressfully?’’Yes I did, and here’s my story……I was hiding in this refrigerator and………..

The tractor joke. There was once a man called Dan and he was obsessed with tractors. He had tractor wall paper, tractor clothes, a tractor duvet and much more. One day his friend found a tractor convention and he thought of Dan, so he bought two tickets for the following day. When Dan got to the convention with his friend he was amazed. They had tractors of all shapes and sizes, but when looking through the tractors, Dan found a beautiful lime green tractor, with a leather steering wheel and a yellow seat. He decided that he would do anything for this tractor, but is wasn’t for sale. So he hid until night when nobody was about and he snuck up to the tractor and was about to hot wire it when he realised that it had the keys still in. As he was driving out with his prize he crashed into one of the main pillars keeping up the shed that the convention was in and it all fell down.The police were called and they pulled Dan from the wreckage. Luckily he wasn’t hurt, but the police knew it was him who knocked the building down so they gave him a choice. Go to jail for 10 years, or he wasn’t allowed to own anything to do with tractors ever again.Dan was weighing up his choices, he loved his tractors, but he was terrified of jail. After spending the night thinking about it, he decided to get rid of all his tractor possessions.Months passed and Dan was incredible lonely, so he downloaded a dating app on hi phone. Some of the girls he met were nice and others were horrible but one day, he met a girl who he really connected with. After texting for a few days they decided to go on a date.At the restaurant they had picked out, he met her in person. When they went in, she asked if they could go to the smoking area of the restaurant. Dan didn’t like smokers, but he let it slide as he was really lonely without his tractors so they went to the smoking area.After a few minutes, Dan was coughing due to the thickness of the smoke, so he took in one big breath, breathed in all the smoke and went outside to breathe it out. When he came back, his date was starting at him in disbelief and she asked how did you do that?	Dan smiled and responded I’m an ex-tractor fan.

About an inch. The UN is in session and the three major superpowers, the US, Russia, and China are trying to out do each other's achievements. The US says we have a missile that could reach any point on Earth with amazing precision and destroy it.Everyone else starts chattering in disbelief and the UN moderator finally questions the statement. Under pressure the US says well... It will land within 1 foot of the target. Everyone seems satisfied with the answer. Russia says we have a missile that could go into space, go hypersonic, and comeback into Earth and kill our target with maximum efficiency. Again people start questioning how unbelievable this sounds. Russia then says well... It will destroy it's target with a precision of about 7 inches.

Three men meet Buddha after their deaths.  Stunned by the divine presence before them, they lower their heads.\-Raise your heads. You were humble in life and your deeds were praiseworthy. You have earned the right to a reincarnation of your choice. You have much to accomplish yet though.One of the people takes a step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled.\-Benevolent Buddha, what more could I possibly do in my next life? I thought I lived and acted to the fullest. Because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve.\-My work was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. Right now, the world I leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.\-My connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.\-I know all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that I ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation.The three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.\-Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?\-Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.\-You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?\-Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.\-This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?\-W-well, I don't know what to tell you.	But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.

Politician dies....  While walking down the street one day a Member of Parliament is tragically hit by a truck and dies. His soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance. 'Welcome to heaven,' says St. Peter. 'Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. We  seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so we're not sure what to do with you.' 'No problem, just let me in,' says the man. 'Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from higher  up. What  we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. Then   you can choose where to spend eternity.' 'Really, I've made up my mind. I want to be in heaven,' says the MP. 'I'm sorry, but we have our rules.' And with  that, St. Peter escorts him to the  elevator and he went down, down, down  to hell. The  doors open and he found himself in the middle of a green golf course. In  the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all his friends and other  politicians who had worked with him. Everyone is very happy and dressed in evening dress. They  run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the expense of the  people. They played a friendly game of golf and then dined on lobster, caviar and champagne   Also present is the devil, who really is a very friendly & nice guy  who has a good time dancing and telling jokes.They are having such a  good time that before he realizes it's time to go. Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and wave whilst the elevator rises.... The elevator rises and the door opens in heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him. 'Now it's time to visit heaven.24  hours pass with the MP joining a group of contented souls moving from  cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time  and, before he realizes it, the 24  hours have gone by and St. Peter returns. 'Well, then, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. now choose your eternity.'

He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls from above. The devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulder. ' I don't understand,' stammers the  MP. 'Yesterday  I was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse, and we ate  lobster and caviar, drank champagne, danced and had a great time. Now  there's just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable. What happened?	The devil looks at him, smiles and says,'Yesterday we were campaigning -    Today you voted’.

The Cheerio. In a land far away a cheerio named John had no life. Cheerios had three social classes, Normal cheerios, honey nut cheerios and frosted cheerios. John was a normal cheerio, no money, no life, nothing. So one day he decided he was going to change that. John got up and decided to get a job at McDonalds. He worked his ass off everyday and he eventually got promoted to the manager of that McDonalds. John woke up the next day, looked in the mirror and realized he was a honey nut cheerio. Even though he became a honey nut cheerio, he wanted more. He kept working hard until he became the CEO of McDonalds. He woke up the next day and looked in the mirror, and he was a glazed cheerio. Glazed cheerios need to have a certain amount of sugar intake to maintain their beautiful glazed outside so John got right to that. The next day, John invited to a glazed cheerio only party that was meant for the biggest glazed cheerios in all the land. When he got there and was partying, he realized that he hadn't consumed enough sugar. Becoming a honey nut cheerio right there would be so embarrassing.

So there was a man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living. He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said, Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just a bad conductor.

One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.The moral of the story - Pay your bills !	!

Three men are stranded on a desert island. (Long) (NSFW) Three men wash up on a desert island. They don’t know each other and don’t know where they are. Soon, they get very hungry. They go into the island to see if they can find any food. They happen to stumble upon an enormous cache of perfectly ripe fruits. They eat to their heart’s delight, and when they are all about to fall asleep, five enormous, muscled, tattooed people step out, wielding clubs.You have stolen from our people! We shall take you to our leader, for he will know what to do. So the men are dragged to the center of the island, and soon face the leader of the tribe they were taken captive by.You have stolen from our people! This is punishable by death! However, since you are foreigners, I have another option for you. iki Shiki. The first man asks, What is iki Shiki?! I know it by no other name. The choice is yours. Death, or iki Shiki.The first man says this, Well, nothing is worse than death. So I choose iki Shiki!Very well. IT IS DECIDED!! IKI SHIKI!The man is dragged into a cave by three hulking warriors, even bigger than the ones that took them to the chief. For a few moments, there is complete silence. And then, the other two men hear something. Oh god! What are you doing?! No! NO! STOP! PLEASE! PLEASE, OH GOD PLEASE!! Then they start hearing awful screams, like nothing on this earth. This goes on for six hours. Finally, the man stops screaming. He exits the cave, pants off. Blood is streaming out of his ass and flecks of shit cover him. He sits down and starts crying immediately. The second man is then given the same choice. Well, that seems pretty horrible. But nothing can be worse than death. So I too choose iki Shiki.Very well. IT IS DECIDED!!! IKI SHIKI! The same warriors drag the second man into the cave. The iki Shiki has begun. The second man starts screaming. He keeps on screaming, never stopping, and the first man starts crying harder and harder. After eight hours, the second man comes out of the cave. His clothes are ripped to shreds and blood is covering his entire body. He lies down in fetal position and starts shaking violently. The third and final man then must choose his fate. Well, before today, I thought nothing was worse than death. But I was wrong. So that is what I choose.Very well. IT IS DECIDED!!!! DEATH! BY IKI SHIKI!!!!!	!

Intrigued, the man asks how it works. Well, you put $100 in and then you'll win the whole jar if you complete three tasks.The jar is quite large and full to the brim with what must be thousands of $100 bills. Excited, he asks, What are the three tasks?The bartender says, Well, first you have to drink three straight pints of whiskey without throwing up. That's three entire pints, mind you. Most people can't do it. Okay, the man says, clearly seeing that this is dangerous but doable, what's the second task?Through this door, I have a pet alligator, and he has a sore tooth. It's been bothering him for ages. You need to pull his tooth for me.Holy shit, the man says, alright, well, what's the third task?My granny lives upstairs, so I can take care of her. She's lonely and hasn't gotten laid in over 30 years. Go upstairs and make her feel young again.The man thinks very hard about these tasks, then nods his head, takes out a fresh, crisp $100 bill and stuffs it into the jar. The bartender pours the three pints of whiskey, which the man promptly starts drinking. It takes him a minute or so, and he nearly vomits, but manages to keep them down. He then goes through the doorway, stumbling slightly, to the alligator room. An immense howling is soon heard, grunting, scratching, and some of most painful and excruciating sounds the bartender has ever heard. After a few minutes, the man stumbles back through the doorway, looking a little worse for the wear, and says, Alright...	So, where's that old lady with the sore tooth?

Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam... His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. What happened? he asked, exasperated.The old monk shook his head sadly. Isn't it obvious? he said.	Sam sung Note 7.

'Just Fred,' the man responds.The officer is in a good mood, thinks he might just give the biker a break, and write him out a warning instead of a ticket. The officer then presses him for the last name.The man tells him that he used to have a last name but lost it.The officer thinks that he has a nut case on his hands but plays along with it. 'Tell me, Fred, how did you lose your last name? 'The biker replies, 'It's a long story, so stay with me.' I was born Fred Johnson. I studied hard and got good grades. When I got older, I realized that I wanted to be a doctor. I went through college, medical school, internship, residency, and finally got my degree, so I was Fred Johnson, MD. After a while I got bored being a doctor, so I decided to go back to school. Dentistry was my dream! Got all the way through School, got my degree, so then I was Fred Johnson, MD, DDS. Got bored doing dentistry, so I started fooling around with my assistant and she gave me VD, so now I was Fred Johnson, MD, DDS, with VD.Well, the ADA found out about the VD, so they took away my DDS. Then I was Fred Johnson, MD, with VD. Then the AMA found out about the ADA taking away my DDS because of the VD, so they took away my MD leaving me as Fred Johnson with VD. Then the VD took away my Johnson, so now I am Just Fred.	'The officer walked away in tears, laughing
A man walks into a bar with a chicken and a bucket. The barman looks puzzled and query’s the man as to why he has these items.

He drinks it, thanks the barman and leaves.Next day he comes in again with the chicken and the bucket. Again he places the bucket down with the barman’s requests and they watch the chicken dance. The barman then has an idea and asks to buy the chicken and bucket as a light entertainment for his bar. The man agrees and sells the man his chicken and bucket for £100.

For his 50th wedding anniversary, a man decided to buy some lingerie for his wife. He went to one of the finer stores in town and asked to see some of their nightgowns. When the salesperson brought out the first item he asked how much it was and was told $100. I’d like something a little more sheer said the gentleman. The salesperson brought out a second item, whereupon the gentleman asked the price and was told it was $250. That’s still not sheer enough, replied the man - bring me out the sheerest nightgown that you have.. When the third nightgown arrived and he saw how thin it was he ponied up the $500 that was on the price tag.When he brought it home he excitedly asked his wife to try it on. She obliged and headed upstairs to change. She noticed the sales receipt for $500 in the box and thought to herself, My goodness-this is so sheer that I doubt he’ll even be able to tell if I’m wearing it. I’ll just stand naked at the top of the stairs, return the item and spend the $500 on something that I really like. She shed all of her clothes and headed out to the top of the stairs, calling to her husband, twirling around and asking him what he thought of the nightgown.

The Policeman & The Hispanic. It’s around the holiday season and Bob the policeman is scheduled to work. He decides to set up a speed trap at his favorite roadway in Arkansas.It’s been a few hours and Bob hasn’t seen a single driver. Just then, suddenly a pickup truck flies past him doing well over double the speed limit! Bob springs into action; he flips his lights, pulls out, runs the truck down, and pulls him over.Bob walks up to the window and sees a Hispanic man in the drivers seat.Sir, do you have any idea how fast you were going? Also where are you headed to?I believe I was doing close to double the speed limit officer. And I’m headed to see me family. replies the Hispanic man.License and registration please says Bob.I do not have them the Hispanic man admits.At this point Bob comes to the conclusion that he is most likely dealing with an illegal immigrant. Albeit the holiday season, despite him not wanting to, Bob took an oath to uphold the law thus he is forced to call ICE. Upon arrival they immediately arrest the Hispanic man and he is deported the next day. Bob feels awful.The next year Bob is once again scheduled to work around the holiday season and is posted at his favorite roadway. Within the first hour a pickup truck flies past him doing easily double the speed limit! Bob immediately turns on his lights, pulls the vehicle over and approaches the drivers window. Much to his surprise it is the same Hispanic man from the year before!Do you know why I pulled you over? Also where are you headed? He asks.The Hispanic man calmly answers. I believe I was doing double the allowed limit. I am headed to see me familyBob is confused and a tad flustered at this point.Sir haven’t we met before? Same time last year? Same circumstances? Have you gotten your citizenship straightened out yet? Yes we have met before. Same time last year under the same circumstances indeed. No I am still not a citizen yet replies the Hispanic man.Bob sighs.He proceeds to call ICE authorities and once more the Hispanic man is arrested and deported the next day. Bob is puzzled.For the third year in a row Bob the policeman is scheduled to work around the holiday season. Per usual, he is sitting at his favorite roadway when his eyes behold an all too familiar sight. A pickup truck blows past him this time doing triple the allowed limit!Bob sounds his siren, chases the vehicle down, and pulls it over. He runs up to the window only to see the same exact Hispanic man from both years prior!Completely bewildered. Sir this is the third year in a row around the same time of year, under the same circumstances! Surely by now you know I will be sitting here yet you still come through here speeding! If you would just do the speed limit you would be able to see your family in peace! He exclaims.Well, if I don’t drive fast enough then I’m afraid I won’t be able to see them as it is not practical for me to purchase a plane ticket. The Hispanic man explains.Sir, i am sorry but I must contact the authorities once again. I’m afraid you will be arrested and deported for the third year in a row. I hate to do this. Bob says.No, no, it’s quite alright really. Replies the Hispanic man.Still very confused, Bob asks. If you don’t mind my asking, where exactly is it that your family lives that you must drive so fast to get?The Hispanic man, with the straightest of faces, looks Bob the policeman dead in his eyes, and smoothly answers.	Cuba.

So a finance professional is traveling to Goldman Sachs to be interviewed for an internship, and he has lost his way... He asks a man in passing, Hey, do you know the way to Goldman Sachs from here? The man nods and says, Yes, just take the next left, travel one block, and it will be on your right. The first man thanks him and is on his way. Sure enough, he comes to a magnificent building coated in gold paint. He goes inside and tells the receptionist that he's here seeking an internship. She directs him to the interviewer's office.The interviewer says, Now, before we go over your qualifications, I want to give you a quick tour of the premises. He leads him to a room and says, This is the harvesting room. The man peers in and sees thousands of gold colored statues of all different sizes. Many workers are disassembling them with hammers, chisels, and Dremels and then separating the pieces into two giant bins.The man is confused, but holds his tongue. The interviewer then leads him to 'The Seeking Center'. Inside, workers are busy talking on the phone and browsing online auctions. The interviewer says, This is where we find and purchase the statues. We use Ebay, Amazon, thrift stores, antique shops, and any other means we can to find and buy statues at competitive prices. The man is a little confused, but only nods and smiles. The interviewer then leads him to 'The Packaging Room'. Inside, workers are packaging scrotums of all different shapes and sizes that had been removed from the statues. The poor man is sweating, blushing, and frankly a little disgusted.The interviewer says, And those tubes over there lead straight to the shipping center and the gift shop! Alright, now let me see your resume. The flustered man says, On second thought, maybe this job isn't for me. I have to go. He rushes past the interviewer and walks briskly to the exit. As he leaves, he reads the sign on the building.	It says, 'Gold Man Sacks'.

One day, a wife came home early and found her husband in their bedroom making love to a very attractive young woman. Naturally, she was very upset. You are a disrespectful pig! she cried. How dare you do this to me! I’m a faithful wife, the mother of your children! I’m leaving you. I want a divorce right away!The husband replied, Hang on just a minute love, so at least I can tell you what happened.Go ahead, she sobbed, but they’ll be the last words you’ll say to me!So the husband began, Well, I was getting into the car to drive home, and this young lady here asked me for a lift. She looked so down and out and defenseless that I took pity on her and let her into the car.I noticed that she was very thin, not well dressed and very dirty. She told me that she hadn’t eaten for three days. So, in my compassion, I brought her home and warmed up the enchiladas I made for you last night. The ones you wouldn’t eat because you’re afraid you’ll put on weight. The poor thing devoured them in moments!Since she needed a good clean-up, I suggested a shower, and while she was doing that, I noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes so I threw them away. Then, as she needed clothes, I gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don’t wear because you say they are too tight.I also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, which you don’t wear because I don’t have good taste.	I found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for Christmas that you don’t wear just to annoy her and I also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and don’t wear because someone at work has the same pair.The husband took a quick breath and continued, She was so grateful for my understanding and help that as I walked her to the door, she turned to me with tears in her eyes and said… Do you have anything else that your wife doesn’t use?

An attractive woman is sitting alone at the bar and sees a man with a military-style haircut sitting by himself at the other end, nursing his drink. The woman notices that the man is looking glum and hasn't made any attempt to speak to anyone besides the barkeep. She takes a swig of liquid courage, saunters down the bar, and sits next to the man. Excuse me, sir, but are you a soldier? I couldn't help but notice your haircut! The woman says innocently. Yes ma'am, I am. I just got back from my second tour of duty, he replies. Oh my! That's very brave of you. I don't mean to be too forthcoming, but you seem kind of down in the dumps. Is everything alright? The woman purrs. The man finishes his drink in a single quaff, takes a long, slow breath and relates to the woman that his longtime girlfriend left him on his first deployment, so he re-upped and went back in for a second tour. The second tour was grueling and gruesome and the man had lost several close friends in combat. He then explains that this was once his favorite bar but now it only brings back bad memories.Goodness! The woman cried. You must be awfully lonely these days! The man nods and quietly says Yes ma'am. All I seem to know is how to be a soldier.The woman, smitten by the handsome soldier, continues to sit beside him and they keep shooting the breeze. Between the booze, good conversation, and the obvious attraction, the pair realize the sexual tension is thick enough to cut with a knife. Forgive me for being brash, but when was the last time you had sex? The woman coos. The soldier thinks for a moment. I'd say probably 2015. The woman is shocked and immediately whispers in his ear that she is going to change that. They catch a ride from the bar to her house, sucking face the whole way there. The two burst inside her home and immediately get hot and heavy. They make love everywhere and in all kinds of positions. After some of the most vigorous and fulfilling sex of their lives, the woman gasps, That was incredible! I can't believe you haven't had sex since 2015! The man turns to her with a puzzled look and says It was that noticeable?	It's only 0100 now!

My team decided to establish a tradition. Everyone on the team would sit in a circle surrounding the team captain before the start of the season. He would then headbutt the ball at one of us, and they would have to headbutt it back at him. The captain would then headbutt it at the person sitting next to them. This would repeat as it cycled through the circle. We tried to get it consistently through the circle as many times as we could. The more times we completed a circle, the better the season would be. We had to stop this tradition, though. Recently, as much as it pains me to say, it caused a death. Kevin was the best teammate we ever had.	Our bowling team just won’t be the same without him.

One was a San Francisco State University graduate from an upper-crust family; well-bred, well-connected and all that goes with it. The other finalist was a redneck from Texas A & M. Go figure.> The rules of the contest required each finalist to compose a four-line poem in one minute or less, and the poem had to contain the word Timbuktu.> The San Francisco State graduate went first. About thirty seconds after the clock started he jumped up and recited the following poem:> 'Slowly across the desert sandTrekked the dusty caravan.Men on camels, two by twoDestination -- Timbuktu.> The audience went wild! How, they wondered if the redneck could top that?! The clock started again and the redneck sat in silent thought.	Finally, in the last few seconds, he jumped and recited:> Tim and me, a-huntin' went.Met three whores in a pop-up tent.They was three, we was two,So I bucked one and Timbuktu

Charlie was visiting an old friend and his wife for dinner... Charlie was visiting an old friend and his wife for dinner. When the time came to leave, his car wouldn't start, and it was too late to call the local service station.The husband urged Charlie to stay over. There was no spare bed in the house--there wasn't even a sofa. So Charlie would have to sleep with the husband and wife. No sooner had the husband fallen asleep when the wife tapped Charlie on the shoulder and motioned for him to come over to her. I couldn't do that, he whispered. Your husband is my best friend! Listen, sugar, she whispered back, there ain't nothing in the whole wide world could wake hime up now. I can't believe that, Charlie said. Certainly if I get on top of you and screw you, he'll wake up won't he? He certainly won't. If you don't believe me, pluck a hair out of his ass and see if that wakes him. Charlie did just that. Reached over and yanked. He was amazed when the husband remained asleep. So he climbed over to the wife's side of the bed and fucked her. When he finished, he climbed back to his own side. It wasn't long before she tapped him on the shoulder and beckoned him over again. Again he yanked a hair to determine if his old friend was asleep. This went on eight times during the night. Each time Charlie screwed the woman, he first pulled out one of the husband's ass hairs.	The ninth time he pulled a hair, the husband awoke and muttered: Listen, Charlie, old pal, I don't mind you fucking my wife, but please stop using my ass for a scoreboard!

So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living. He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said, Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just a bad conductor.

The Brick. Those askreddit threads reminded me of this old one.A man is building a house out of bricks. When it's finished he walks inside and finds a random brick in the middle of a room on the floor. Thinking to himself: I know I used every last brick to build this house. I wonder where this brick came from? He calls into the house his partner who helped him build the house and shows him the brick. The other man shrugs, picks up the brick, opens a window and throws the brick out of the window! Just like that, the man couldn't believe it!Across town, a bus was setting off on a long journey. On the bus was a man opening his book and settling in for the long journey ahead. After only a few minutes into the ride, a *yap yap yap* noise came from the seats behind him. The yapping continued until, fed up, the man jumped up and scowled over the seat to the woman behind him and her yapping dog. He bellows, Can you please quiet your dog! The woman returns his scowl with one of her own and says No! I will not silence my pet, it is a dog and I'm allowed to have it and dogs yap! Mind your own business! The man returns to his side of the seat and opens his window in hopes the fresh air helps calm him, and the sound of the wind drowns out the annoying yaps. *yap yap yap* The man lights up a cigar and begins to smoke. Taking long pulls and blowing the smoke making sure it's blown directly in the woman's direction.He feels a tap on his shoulder. The woman from the seat behind him is standing over his seat and coughing, she says: put that out! It's making me and my dog cough!No! I will not. I am allowed to have it! Mind your own business! he says with a wry smile.The woman angrily grabs the cigar and throws it out of the bus window. Then the man angrily stands up, grabs the dog and throws it out of the window.A few minutes of yelling and insults and the bus driver stops to handle the commotion. He orders them both off of the bus. Standing on the side of the road they notice something running towards them. It was the dog! And what do you think the dog had in it's mouth? The cigar?Nope.	The fucking brick.

For the rest of the night, he keeps winning and downing drink after drink. The next morning he wakes up in his hotel room, looks in the mirror and sees he has a black eye.

Cake day. Every morning, at precisely 7:00 AM, my neighbor knocks upon my door, looking to borrow some milk. And every morning, I cheerfully greet him and oblige. At the end of the week my neighbor brings me a new bottle of milk to replace the milk he has consumed. Then for the next week, I give him milk from this bottle. But yesterday he also asked to borrow a stick of butter and two eggs to make a cake.So yesterday, I was a little surprised when he called upon my doorstep at three in the afternoon. I was expecting that maybe he had brought some cake, but instead he presented me with a whole carton of eggs *and* a whole carton of butter. I asked him why he brought entire cartons when he hadn't borrowed that much. Was he expecting to use more sometime soon?	But no, he said it was just great appreciation for this extra owing dairy occasion.

So they wait out the spring, and they leave the dog in the  summer.The summer passed and at the first days of autumn they went to get their dog.Now the hunting season was open, they went up the woods with their dog, after couple of hours searching for animals they spotted a hole in the ground, they started shooting at it BANG!

A Polish man from a small village is flying for the first time. It's your standard 747 with four engines, and after some initial nervousness, the man, we'll call him Bart, is feeling at ease after a smooth takeoff and ascent. This is just a short flight from Warsaw to Berlin, and they should be landing in less than 2 hours.20 minutes into the flight, a shudder is felt through the plane and the pilot comes on the loudspeaker, Folks, we have just lost power in one of our engines. Should be nothing to worry about, we will still be landing safely very soon. Bart shrugged off the incident and figured if that's the worst thing that happens today, it would still be a success.A half hour later, another shudder went through the plane, the passengers gasped, and the pilot came on the PA again. Friends, we have lost power to another engine. We still have two functioning engines, and we should have no problems reaching our destination. We apologize for the issues. Bart was starting to feel slightly uneasy now, but was still confident they would reach Berlin.Later, about 20 minutes out from their destination, another vibration was felt and the plane listed to the right for a few moments, then stabilized. The pilot made another announcement, this time more nervously, Ladies and gentlemen, we have lost power to a third engine. We still hope to make it to Berlin safely, please remain calm. Bart and the other passengers were now visibly shaken, praying that the last functional engine held out until they could land.Thankfully, the plane reached Berlin and landed safely. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief as they taxied to the gate and began to deplane.	As Bart gathered his things, he laughed and remarked to the man seated next to him, It's a good thing we didn't lose that last engine, or we would have been up there all night!

An artist is commissioned to paint a mural in the newly built city hall. The city council has decided the mural must be an important scene from American history. The artist accepts the deal with one condition. No one can see the piece before it is completed.Begrudgingly, the town council accepts, a contract is signed, and the artist begins work behind a massive curtain. The artist goes so far as to hire a security firm who have signed non disclosure agreements. After 4 months of work, the mural is complete. A massive unveiling is planned. The local media, the high school band, the entire town, and the state governor are all in attendance. With much fanfair, the curtain is dropped. The 60 foot wide by 20 foot tall mural is revealed. The mural depicts a beautiful scene of the American Southwest, filled with brilliant colors and amazing details. There are hundreds of Native Americans in amazingly accurate period correct clothing from the late 1800's. Everyone is in awe... Until they start looking a little closer.Many of the the Native Americans are in various stages of undress. They are all engaged in coitus in every position and combination imaginable. All in photograph- quality detail. But it gets worse. Interspersed throughout the scene of debauchery, there are enormous piles of feces. Fly-ridden and festering in the sun. After a moment of focusing on it, you could swear you could smell it. The piles of waste have beams of golden light descending from the heavens onto them. Some of the piles even have halos above them. Everyone is now silent, mouths agape at what they're seeing. Finally, the governor bellows out, What have you done here? This is disgusting! Explain yourself!The artist calmly replied, I did exactly what was asked of me. I have painted a piece of art depicting an important moment in American history. This represents the last words uttered by General George Custer at the battle of Litttle Big Horn. Holy shit.	Look at all those fucking Indians.
