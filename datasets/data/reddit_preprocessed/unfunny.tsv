So horse wants to start band... .  The horse needs some of his friend from the farm to help him out so they can become band.

Next he needs drummer, so horse thought about asking sheep who was professional drummer for another band long time ago. Sheep agrees and says he'll play. Finally horse needed to find bassist. This was difficult because no one he knew played the bass, but one of chicken friends, pig, played the bass so chicken asked his friend if he wanted to join. Pig said sure so pig came to the farm to meet the rest of the band Theyplayed couple of gigs and got really good over the period of months, so good in fact they were asked by famous television talk show host if they wanted to come in and perform for the show. The band gladly agreed and got ready to go. The host was couple of states away so they had to take plane, and so the day came and they went on the plane early. Turned out the flight was overbooked and so horse said that he could wait for the next one since they were so early. Horse took the next flight while later and landed after couple hours.

Out of curiosity and wanting to see if he could help, the bartender approached the horse and asked, Why the long face?

Theold man paused and looked around the group. Have you ever heard of the Sahara Forest? he asked. Youmean the Sahara Desert? asked one of the other lumberjacks.	Theold man looked back with smile and said, so is that what they're calling it now?

So what's your story? Sothe first man replies: Well, for while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As came into my 25th floor apartment, could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this naked man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now was really mad, so started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally went back into my apartment and got hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell-but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. couldn't stand it anymore, so ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and had heart attack and died right then and there on the balcony. Thatsounds like pretty bad day to me, said Peter, and let the man in. The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. It's been very strange day. You see, live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and one of my favorite hobbies is dancing around naked while eating pickles out of glass jar. As was doing so the other day, slipped on an errant pickle and slipped over the balcony. But got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. knew couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. thought for sure was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. held on the best could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally just let go, but thankfully fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. thought was the luckiest guy in the world, but refrigerator fell out of the sky and crushed me to death! Onceagain, Peter had to concede that that sounded like pretty horrible death. The third man came to the front of the line, and again the whole process was repeated. Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story.	The man responds: Idied naked inside refrigerator.

Hepaused and listened. Butthere was no reply. Toottoot toot!! Hecalled even louder. Again,silence. Satowas furious, he refused to be robbed of this golden opportunity. He took gulp of water and braced for the loudest call of his life.

traveling cowboy walks into saloon .  to rest and get drink before continuing on his journey. As he sat down at one end of the bar the bartender walks over to him and asks what he would like to drink. Beersays the traveling cowboy. Rightaway says the bartender as he makes his way to the tap. Asthe cowboy watched the bartender fill clean mug with crisp lager he noticed strange shape out of the corner of his eye. He turned his gaze towards it and his eyes widened in surprise as he realized what he was looking at. At the far end of the bar seated in stool sat full sized horse whose eyes were filled with tears. large jar filled with an assortment of coins and Bill's sat on the bar next to the horse. Though he was traveling man and had seen many things over many years this was without doubt the strangest sight the traveling cowboy had ever seen. Thebartender shortly returned with our cowboy's drink and as he sat it on the bench in front of him the cowboy spoke and asked, Whyis there full grown horse sitting on that there stool? And why is he crying? Wellsir says the Bartender about one year ago this horse walked into this saloon with tears in his eyes, sat down in that very spot and ordered himself drink. Hasn't moved or done nothin' else since. No one knows why he came in here or where he came from but one thing is for certain. Whatever horrors he witnessed to put him in such state would not like to know myself, nor would any man reckon. WellI'll be says the Cowboy. What's that there jar for? Afew months after he came some of my regular customers started making bets. Who ever can make that horse to do anything other than sit there and mourn takes the jar and all the money in it. Uponhearing this the Cowboy shook his head, drained his mug in one gulp, wiped his lips, stood up and walked over to the horse. The bartender watched in surprise as the cowboy sat down next to the horse and whispered in the horses ear. The tears in the horses eyes remained but no longer were they tears of sorrow. The horse erupted in violent fit of laughter so loud in could be heard from the street outside the saloon. The cowboy, satisfied with his work stood up, grabbed the jar of money, tipped his hat to the bartender (who at this point was in state of utter disbelief) and walked out the door. Ayear later the same traveling cowboy walked into the same saloon and sat down in the same spot he had the year prior. As he sat down he turned his gaze to the far side of the bar and quite to his surprise the horse was still there. Another jar had replaced the one he had taken, and the horse was still possessed by state of violent laughter. Yelled the bartender who had just turned and recognized the face of the traveling cowboy. You think you can come back into my saloon after what you've done? That horse has not stopped laughing since the day you came in here and made him do so! It's been so disruptive can't get anyone to come in here besides my regulars, and all they do is bet on that damned horse. Who ever can get him to do anything other than takes the jar and all of its contents. WellI'll be. Says the cowboy as he stood up and slowly walked over to the horse. Thebartender watched as the cowboy made his way to the far side of the bar. He watched the cowboy stand in front of the horse with his back facing the bartender. The bartender watched in an almost euphoric state of shock as the horse's laughter stopped. As the cowboy stood there, the horses countenance fell to the same state it was one year prior. Tears welled up in his eyes and he began to weep once again. Satisfiedwith his work the cowboy grabbed the new jar and again tipped his hat to the bartender as he made his way to the door. Waitjust goddamn minute! The bartender screamed. Ibeg your pardon? The cowboy replied as he turned and began walking back toward the bar. Wellhell. You come in here one year ago and you say somthing to that horse, which mind you, had not done nothin' but cry and mourn for one year prior to your arrival. Something so goddamn funny that he then cannot do anything but laugh and be disruptive for the next year, driving away all my customers. Then you come in here now and just stand there and he stops!? You put me through all that and you're just gonna walk out of this saloon without so much as goodbye? Well that don't sit right with me. So demand that you tell me what you did to that horse to make his laugh and then cry like that. Iguess do owe you that bartender. Says the travelling Cowboy.

spy, an artist, and basketball player are chewing the fat on the beach .  It was lovely day so the three friends got together to enjoy each other's company and engage in stimulating discussions about various topics. The spy was initially hesitant to rendezvous at the beach, as she preferred more secluded settings where she had chance to blend in with the crowd. On the beach, this was not possible, as she possessed an unrivaled figure that would be sure to attract attention from horny onlookers. But the spy recognized the futility of her efforts to persuade her stubborn friends so she ultimately decided to dress as modestly as possible in hopes of deflecting unwelcome eyes. It didn't work. She was the only person within five-mile radius who came overdressed for the occasion. The artist noticed that there were group of teenagers playing volleyball nearby and went over to ask them if he could join. The basketball player was puzzled by his friend's initiative, as everyone considered the artist something of recluse. Perhaps the sun worked in mysterious ways and inspired in the artist what little social sensibility he could muster. The spy didn't think much of the gesture and turned her attention to the basketball player. Why don't you go join them? She asked. After all, you're professional athlete. You know why responded the basketball player. most certainly do not replied the spy. In that case, I'm not going to tell you. The day was growing old and the three friends said their goodbyes before retreating to their abodes. The spy reclined on her love seat and had glass of wine while putting on her favorite record. The artist sat in his attic and painted scene inspired by the day's events on the beach. He would take intermittent breaks to meditate and reflect. By the time he was finished with his painting, it was so marvelous and captured the authentic feeling of his experience on the beach so accurately that it was almost too beautiful to bear. He was impressed by his ability to directly translate his complicated emotions to the canvas and vowed to never grow complacent or satisfied with his progress for fear of resigning himself to idleness. Across town, the basketball player reached her home. That's the joke, the basketball player is woman.	You don't have to like it.

When go downstairs, wanna see fucking choo choo train wrapped around the god damn Christmas tree, and when go outside wanna see big fucking red bike in my god damn garage.

Man is walking down the street when he finds Catholic Church .  man is walking along the street one day when he comes across Catholic church on the side of road. As he walks by, he hears the most beautiful, gorgeous, blissful music coming from the inside of the church. Curious, and eager to find out what the source of such magical noise could be, he opens the great wooden door and rushes in to find humble, old priest bent over the alter, praying, while the music continues on in the background. Rushing over to the priest the man says My dear sir! What is that beautiful music hear echoing through this gorgeous church? What is the source of such wonderful sound? The old Catholic priest smiles and turns to the man, his old bones having slowed him down in his old age. Looking up at the man with bemusement, wish could tell you. he croaks. Slightly frustrated, the man pulls at his hair, desperate to know the source of the music. Well then why can't you tell me? The priest laughs again. If you want to know, you must become Catholic priest for at least 20 years, as did, many years ago, before tell you of the source of this noise. Only Catholic priest can see the source of the noise. The man quickly thanks the old priest, and with increased vigor, and an unquenchable thirst to find out what the source of the noise is, decides he will become Catholic priest for 20 years to find out what the source is. Interestingly enough, not many people were applying to become Catholic priests at the time, didn't seem to be quite popular job, but the man persevered, and became Catholic priest. The job was demanding, and he wasn't particularly good at it, but come 20 years, the man, now old and feeling about as frail as the priest he had met 20 years ago, makes his way to that Catholic church he stumbled upon two decades ago, ready to discover the source of the noise. The man opens the great wooden door of the church and finds the same old priest bent over the alter. The aged priest looks so old he could practically whither to dust before the mans eyes. Eager that the past 20 years had finally come to its culmination, the man rushes up to the old priest and proudly declares his accomplishment. I've done it! he says proudly. did what you said, and I've been Catholic priest these past long 20 years. Will you show me the source of this gorgeous, this lovely music now? Slowly moving his head to look up at the man, as if afraid to injure himself, the kindly old priest nods. You have done well, and come at the proper time too. feel as though my time here on this earth is up, and it is now time for you to know what the source of this music is, and for you to now watch over the source of the he grabs at the mans arms. Pull me up, for am an old man now, and my legs are weary. The two of them hobble to the old priests office, tucked away across the chapel. The old Catholic priest unlocks the door to his office, and opens up drawer in his desk, before pulling out rusty, old fashioned key. The man and the priest slowly make their way across the chapel to an ancient, plain looking wooden door. The priest unlocks the door to reveal dark flight of wooden stairs that lead down. The duo make their way down the stairs, and walk down deep dank, dimly lit passageway. They walk for about solid 20 minutes before they reach solid looking, but plain, iron door. The music is louder than it was before, and the man figures the source has to be just behind the solid, but plain, iron door. He tries the handle, but its locked. The old priest lets out laugh. Darn it! I've forgotten the key to the door, its in my office. The man chuckles, although little annoyed. It can happen to the best of us. The two of them leave the iron door, walk down the long dank passageway, up the flight of old wooden stairs, and through the wooden door, across the chapel, and into the priests office. The old priest opens different drawer this time, and grabs different, iron key. They then make their way across the chapel, through the wooden door, down the flight of old wooden stairs, walk down the long dank passageway, and back to the plain iron door. The old priest unlocks the plain iron door, and the two of them make their slow passage down long, but steeply declining hallway until the two of them come across an ominous pristine stainless steel door, looming ahead of them. The music is even louder then it was before. The old priest moves to unlock the door, when he stops and smacks his forehead. Darn it! I've forgotten the key to the door. It's in my office. The man grimaces, but masks the rest of his frustration as the two of them leave the ominous stainless steel door, up the declining hallway, through the iron door, walk down the long dank passageway, up the flight of old wooden stairs, and through the wooden door, across the chapel, and into the priests office. The old priest opens different drawer this time, and grabs different, steel key. They then make their way across the chapel, through the wooden door, down the flight of old wooden stairs, walk down the long dank passageway, through the iron door, down the declining hallway, and back to the ominous stainless steel door. The old priest fumbles with the key for bit before he unlocks the stainless steel door, and the two of them continue down rustic, stone hallway. They walk for while before the man notices the noise is even louder than before, and the two of them come across polished bronze door. The old priest moves to unlockd the door, when he stops and smacks his forehad. Darn it! I've forgotten the key to the door. It's in my office. His temper building, the man grudgingly follows the old priest away from the polished bronze door, back down the rustic stone hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, up the declining hallway, through the iron door, walk down the long dank passageway, up the flight of old wooden stairs, and through the wooden door, across the chapel, and into the priests office. The old priest opens different drawer this time, and grabs different, bronze key. They then make their way across the chapel, through the wooden door, down the flight of old wooden stairs, walk down the long dank passageway, through the iron door, down the declining hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, down the rustic stone hallway, and back to the polished bronze door. The old priest fumbles with the key for bit before he unlocks the polished bronze door. The man and the old priest make their way down sleek metallic hallway, and the man notices that the gorgeous, beautiful music is even louder then it was at the bronze door. They continue walking till they reach splendid silver door, its craftsmanship exceedingly fine, the music louder than ever. The old priest pauses before opening this door. Forgive me, he says, bending over. am an old man, and my body is not what it used to be. The man shrugs. Who was he, to judge this elder for weariness? They wait for moment before the old priest moves to unlock the splendid silver door, when he sotp and smacks his forehead. Don't tell me- the man starts, when the old priest cries Darn it! I've forgotten the key to the door. It's in my office. His temper building, but still longing to know what the source of the music is, the old priest and the man leave the splendid silver door, go back down the sleek metallic hallway, through the polished bronze door, back down the rustic stone hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, up the declining hallway, through the iron door, walk down the long dank passageway, up the flight of old wooden stairs, and through the wooden door, across the chapel, and into the priests office. The old priest opens different drawer this time, and grabs different, silver key. They then make their way across the chapel, through the wooden door, down the flight of old wooden stairs, walk down the long dank passageway, through the iron door, down the declining hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, down the rustic stone hallway, through the polished bronze door, down the sleek, metallic hallway, and back to the splendid silver door. The old man fumbles with his key for bit before he unlocks the door, and the two of them go down flight of polished obsidian stairs, till they reach gorgeous, gem encrusted golden door, the music now the loudest it had ever been, practially deafining, but all the more beautiful and gorgeous. The man falls to his knees at the gem encrusted golden door, he could spend an eternity here, and still not fully appreciate its beauty. Don't worry. the priest says. This is the final door to the source of the music. The man is grateful, his quest if finally at its end, the wait finally over. The old priest moves to unlock the door, before smacking his head. Darn it! I've forgotten the key to the door. It's in my office. The man can forgive the old priest for his awful, awful memory at this point. It's the last door after all, and he can stand just one more trip with the old priest to his office. The two of them leave the gem encrusted, golden door, back up the polished obsidian stairs, go through the splendid silver door, go back down the sleek metallic hallway, through the polished bronze door, back down the rustic stone hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, up the declining hallway, through the iron door, walk down the long dank passageway, up the flight of old wooden stairs, and through the wooden door, across the chapel, and into the priests office. The old priest opens different drawer this time, and grabs different, golden key. They then make their way across the chapel, through the wooden door, down the flight of old wooden stairs, walk down the long dank passageway, through the iron door, down the declining hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, down the rustic stone hallway, through the polished bronze door, down the sleek, metallic hallway, through the splendid silver door, down the polished obsidian stairs, and back to the gorgeous, gem encrusted golden door. The old priest and the man reach the door, before the old priest stumbles, grabbing at the mans arm. My boy, he says, practically grasping for breath. My boy, he repeats my time here on this earth is now coming to close. He clutches at his chest. The man urgently makes move to move the old priest up so he can carry him to hospital. The old priest however, stops him. No my boy, wish to die here, next to this golden door have long cherished, listening to this music that have long protected. He slides down, laying against the wall adjacent to the golden door. entrust you now, with both the protection of this church, and this music. Can you do that for me, my boy? Tears streaming down the mans eyes, he clasps the old priests hands, taking the golden key. will he stutters. will. And before the mans eyes, the old priest dies, at peace. The man now solemnly turns to the gorgeous golden door, and unlocks it, the gorgeous music now playing as crystal clear as ever, the source of the music shown to him at last, inside revealing vast open room, and in the center of it sits— I'msorry, can't tell you.	You're not Catholic priest.

All his old mates simply swam away whenever he came close to them. Justin didn't realise that his new menacing appearance was the cause of his sad plight. While swimming alone one day he saw the cod again and he thought that perhaps he fish could change him back into prawn. He approached the cod and begged to be changed back, and, lo and behold, he found himself turned back into prawn. With tears of joy in his tiny little eyes Justin swam back to his friends and bought them all cocktail. Looking around the gathering at the reef he realised he couldn't see his old pal.' Where's Christian?' he asked.' He's at home, still distraught that his best friend changed sides to the enemy and became shark', came the reply. Eager to put things right again and end the mutual pain and torture, he set off to Christian's abode. As he opened the coral gate memories came flooding back. He banged on the door and shouted, me, Justin, your old friend, come out and see me again.' Christian replied, way man, you'll eat me. you're now shark, the enemy and I'll not be tricked into being your dinner.' Justin cried back No, I'm not. That was the old me. I've changed.' ............... found Cod.	I'm prawn again Christian'

You're Not Monk .  man is driving down the road and breaks down near monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, My car broke down. Do you think could stay the night? Themonks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can't tell you. You're not monk. The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Someyears later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can't tell you. You're not monk. Theman says, All right, all right. I'm \*dying\* to know. If the only way can find out what that sound was is to become monk, how do become monk? Themonks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become monk. Theman sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth. Themonks reply, Congratulations. You are now monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound. Themonks lead the man to wooden door, where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door. The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, Real funny. May have the key? The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door. So, the monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behindthat door is another door, this one made of sapphire. So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door. Theman is relieved to no end. He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.	Butcan't tell you what it is because you're not monk.

Once upon time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived young monk named Sam. .  His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below. Samwas particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one. Andon Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... Andthe next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings. Andon it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there. Suddenly,to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam. Thetownsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief. Themayor approached the lead monk of the order. What happened? he asked, exasperated. Theold monk shook his head sadly. Isn't it obvious? he said.	Sam sung Note 7.

In the beginning, when Man was first created, all the members of the body held meeting to decide who should be in charge. .  The brain said that it should be in charge because it had the power of decision making and so controlled what everything else in the body did. The eyes pointed out that they were the ones who saw everything, including whatever objectives the brain was going to decide to pursue, so they should be in charge. The arsehole tried to say something at this point but was interrupted: The ears said that they should be in charge because not even the eyes could look in all directions at once, whereas the ears were vigilant no matter which way the body was facing, and could even warn of danger when the eyes were shut. The heart said this was all very well, but without the tireless work it did in bringing blood to all parts of the body neither the brain nor the eyes nor the ears would last half minute, so the heart should be in charge. Again the arsehole started to speak but was shouted down. The stomach pointed out that it had to process food before the heart would have anything worth carrying around, so it ought to be in charge. The hands said that they were the ones responsible for picking up whatever the brain decided on and the eyes saw, and without them the stomach would never get anything, so they should be in charge. The legs commented that they were the ones actually responsible for taking the body from place to place, so they ought to be in charge. The arsehole made final attempt to put its case, but everyone else told it to piss off and shut the fuck up. This upset the arsehole so it decided to go on strike and see how everyone else liked it. Pretty soon the brain was feeling faint, the eyes had spots before them, the ears were ringing, the heart was fluttering, the stomach was queasy, the hands were clammy and the legs were wobbly. They all asked the arsehole very politely to get back to work, but the arsehole said that they'd had their chance to be nice about it and there was no way it was going back to work unless it could be in charge. And while the other parts of the body tried to hold out, it soon became clear that unless the arsehole got its way things were going to just get worse and worse, so eventually there was nothing for it but to give in.	And from that day to this, whenever there is body or organisation of any sort, there's always an arsehole in charge.

Phil Smith's Scrotum .  Suzie Smith stood up and walked to the podium. She said, have praise. Two months ago, my husband, Phil, was in terrible bicycle wreck and his scrotum was completely crushed.

My longest Pickup line.( Itsactually poem) .  In the Garden of Eden, As everyone knows, Lives Adam and Eve, Without any clothes. In this garden, Were two little leaves, One covered Adam's, One covered Eve's. As the story goes on, Never the less to say, The wind came along, And blew the leaves away. At the sight, Adam did stare, There was Eve's treasure, All covered with hair. And wonder came, Under Eve's eyes, As Adam's thing, Started to rise. They found spot, That suited them best, nice big tree, Where they began to rest. Her legs spread wider, And wider apart, While thrill after thrill, Came into her heart. The head of Adam's thing, Peeked into the hole, And filled her with passion, Beyond her control. Backward and forward, His thing did slide, And Eve's treasure, Was all wet inside. The joy was good, She wouldn't let loose, Until Adam's thing, Was all out of juice. Then down through the years, People did screw, And now it is time, For me and you.	So pull down your pants, And lay in the grass, Cause I'm in the mood, For piece of that

There is store in Spain that sells exquisite handmade writing instruments. .  This store has all kinds of bespoke fountain pens and rollerball pens and even ball point pens. There are pens made of fine hard woods and precious metals inlaid with all kinds of gems. These pens are all handmade by artisans who have been in the business for generations. Butwhat really sets this shop apart is their ink master. Most people buy pens with black ink or blue ink or even red ink, mostly because they do not know the world of colors of ink available at this shop. These fine inks are carefully blended by this ink master, prodigy among those with sense for color. There are colors so deep you feel you could fall into them, so vibrant you'd think they were alive, and so bright you'd think they were on fire. Every color imaginable and some you can't even imagine are available here. However the ink master is rarely at the store, he travels the world sourcing ingredients for his magnificent inks. Velvet Red ink made from the shell of Japanese beetle. Royal blue ink made from the petals of an African flower that only blooms once every four years. Making sure these ingredients are available for his customers keeps this whiz of ink away for months sometimes years at time. Butwhile people come from all over the world to buy this artisan ink maker's products, very few ever actually think they'll get chance to meet him.	Becausenobody expects the Spanish ink whiz is in.

Engineers! .  Background information: InIndia we have long distance trains which are pulled using engines and have toilet facilities, and seats which double as beds. It issues two types of tickets one is to ride the train (used by people to travel short distances, 8-10hrs) and another is to ride the train and have seat assigned (used for longer distances). Wealso have, in certain cities like Mumbai, local train system, which is electric, has only seats (which people do sometimes use as beds) and no toilet facilities, usually running within the city or to closer by towns short distance away, usually the entire journey is under 5hrs Ontothe joke.5 doctors and engineers had to go out of the city, so they had short 5-6 hour travel in the long distance train. The doctors had purchased ticket each and the engineers bought ticket and split the cost. The ticket collector came around to check the tickets. He clipped the tickets of each of the doctors and in the meantime all the engineers went and hid in the toilet. The knocked on the door, it was opened ever so slightly and the single ticket was thrust out, the checked it, clipped it and gave it back. On the return journey, the doctors were angry to have spent money. They decided to use the same trick as the engineers. They bought ticket amongst themselves, the engineers noted this and didn't buy any tickets at all. When the arrived the doctors and engineers all went to hide in the toilet. The doctors were smiling thinking the engineers would be fined, when there is knock on their door asking for ticket. One of the doctors hands out the ticket and the engineer who asked for it takes it and goes back to the toilet they have hidden in.

Theyreach the city and there is further train they need to take to reach their work place. The doctors decide they won't but any ticket and will trick the engineers. The engineers all purchase ticket apiece. The comes and the doctors smugly get up to hide in the toilet and the engineers quietly sit and have their tickets clipped.

Butch the Rooster .  Sarah was in the fertilized egg business. She had several hundred young pullets and ten roosters to fertilise the eggs. Shekept records and any rooster not performing went into the soup pot and was replaced. Thistook lot of time, so she bought some tiny bells and attached them to her roosters. Each bell had different tone, so she could tell from distance which rooster was performing. Now, she could sit on the porch and fill out an efficiency report by just listening to the bells. Sarah'sfavourite rooster, old Butch, was very fine specimen but, this morning she noticed old Butch's bell hadn't rung at all! When she went to investigate, she saw the other roosters were busy chasing pullets, bells-a-ringing, but the pullets hearing the roosters coming, would run for cover. ToSarah's amazement, old Butch had his bell in his beak, so it couldn't ring. He'd sneak up on pullet, do his job, and walk on to the next one. Sarahwas so proud of old Butch, she entered him in Show and he became an overnight sensation among the judges.

Several years ago, Great Britain funded study to determine why the head on man's penis is larger than the shaft... .  ... Thestudy took two years and cost over 1.2 million pounds. The study concluded that the reason the head of man's penis is larger than the shaft is to provide the man with more pleasure during sex. After the results were published, France decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. They were convinced that the results of the British study were incorrect. After three years of research at cost of in excess of million Euros, the French researchers concluded that the head of man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex. When the results of the French study were released, Australia decided to conduct their own study. The Aussies didn't really trust British or French studies. So, after nearly three hours of intensive research and cost of right around 75 dollars (three cases of beer), the Aussie study was complete.

Just heard this variation on an oldie! .  hat maker was trying to sell his hats on hot summers day. After having no luck for hours under the sun, he decided to take short rest underneath gigantic tree. He set his briefcase of hats down, took one out to cover his face, and laid down on the grass. With the shade from his hat and the warmth of the ground beneath him, he felt drowsy and quickly fell asleep. When he woke up an hour later, he was startled to find that his briefcase was open, and his hats were missing. Hethen heard curious sound above him. only to notice that the tree was filled with chatty monkeys all wearing his hats! He quickly tried offering them sticks or dropped fruits in exchange for his hats, but the monkeys seemed to only make fun of him. Furious, he threw stick at one of the monkeys, which resulted in shower of thrown sticks back at him. Ducking for cover, he backed off to another nearby tree where he thew his hat down in frustration. To his amazement, the monkeys, seemingly copying him, threw their hats down as well! He quickly picked up his hats and ran away. The hat maker went on to have very successful business, getting married and having many children and eventually grandchildren. He passed on his knowledge of the trade to his oldest son before retiring, who upheld the family business and eventually passed it on to his oldest son as was tradition. few generations passed, and the new owner and grandson of the hat maker was selling hats on hot day, when he too decided to take short rest underneath very similar tree. One thing lead to another, and he found himself waking up to his hats having been stolen by monkeys! However, he remembered the old story his grandfather had told him about outwitting some monkeys, and threw his hat down. single monkey climbed down the tree and took the hat before making rude gesture and scurrying back up. Stumped and enraged, he screamed at the monkey.	The monkey replied: Hey idiot, you're not the only one with grandfather.

There is large monastery, where the sound has originated. He knocks on the door and monk answers. Hello said the boy. Yes? Replies the monk. Iheard bell coming from here yesterday, I'd like to know what it was. Asked the boy. The monk replied, I'm sorry, can't tell you, you're not monk. Theboy made the long ride back down the mountain and forgot about the bell. years later on his 16 birthday, he bought his first car. The same day, he heard the strange bell again, and decided to investigate again, maybe he'd have better luck this time. He took his car and drove hours up the mountain to the monastery.

So again the boy departed home. 15 years later, the boy is now man, married, with beautiful children and red sports car. He hears the bell one day after work, and speeds up the mountain, this time he's there in an hour and fifteen minutes. He arrives at the monastery and has the same interaction as the two previous times. So finally he says want to be monk, to find out what that noise is. The monk said, First, you must sell your car, divorce your wife, abandon your kids and all your possessions, when you're done, we can begin. The man does what he's told and comes back month later. The monk is pleased to see him. Take off your clothes, put on these robes and shave your head the man complies. Am monk now? No, now read this encyclopedia and memorize everything, then you'll be closer to being monk. The man memorized every word in the book and informs the other monk. It has taken him years. Am monk now? The man pleaded, no, Now want you to find the needle in the hayfield out in the courtyard, then cut each blade of grass with scissors. This task takes the man 10 years. Am monk Yes, you're monk what is the bell the monk points to door down the corridor. The new monk opens the door to see another, slightly smaller door. Then another. And another, until he's only able to reach his arms through to open them. And finally he learns what the sound was, do you want to know what it is?	I'msorry can't tell you, you're not monk

No problem, says the fairy. expanded your garage and whenever you wish for car it's already inside next to all the other sporty cars and you will be able to drive different sports car every day of the year. The third guy now proceeds: really enjoy living in that big mansion by the sea but the only thing that would be even better would be my very own island with an even bigger mansion on it. No problem, says the fairy, The boatsman on your private yacht will take you to your very own private island.

farmer finds one of his pigs dead in his pasture. .  Without haste, the farmer phones the police and animal control requesting for assistance with the removal of the massive giant and dispose of it humanely. After 10 minutes had passed, police cruiser with two constables and an animal control van with two animal control officers arrive on the scene and begin their duties. Thetwo animal control officers quickly get to work with lifting the behemoth swine into their van, while the two constables interview the farmer on what happened. The farmer tells his story, giving every single detail of what happened and claims that the death of his pig was due to the pesticides he may have used for dusting his crops, but suggests the officers that they should investigate further as the farmer tells them that strangers have been coming onto his property at the late hours of the evening trying to sneak away with new crop the farmer had recently planted. The constables agree and confer with the officers to give them details upon their findings as they perform an autopsy at their control centre. Afew days pass and the constables receive news from animal control via phone call and tell them they are sending the dissected pig to their morgue for further examination. Ten minutes later, the same two officers arrive with the pig in the van and are led by the constables to the morgue with two large Tupperware containers in hand. They arrive in the morgue and begin to pull out the carcass, piece by piece onto the gurney in front of them. Then one of the officers pulls out three plastic bags full of greenery covered in mucus. One of the constables askes what they are and the officers says it's marijuana. The constables rush the bags of assumed marijuana to the laboratory for further examination and the results were the greenery in the bags were indeed marijuana. Relievedthat their findings were true, one of the constables phones the farmer to give the news. The farmer answers the phone and the constable tells him of his findings. Sir,we have some news on your late pig, the constable starts, after our findings from animal control, we have found that your swine ate plentiful amount of greenery which caused the sudden death of it. And?Was it resulted from some pesticide had used? The farmer questioned very curiously. Fortunately,no, the constable begins, your pig ingested heavy amount of marijuana which in turn caused your pig to overdose. Thefarmer relieved by the constable's news, made light of the situation, saying, Well, guess finally figured out what breed of pigs I'm raising. Andwhat breed would that be, sir? The constable asks.	Thefarmer let out hearty chuckle before he replied, Pot-bellied pigs.

Twist expansion of the fly in the beer story .  bar in has an amateur social scientist as bartender. He's decided to put flies into the beers of customers, to measure and document the reactions of people of different nationalities. Since he fancies himself as chivalrous gentleman, he doesn't do this with female customers (actually, he doesn't want to ruin any chance he has of getting them into his bed, or the back room.) So his targets are men. Hereis his experiment journal. Monday:Subject#1: Englishman, age approximately 40. Called me over and said he couldn't drink the beer because of the fly and demanded another on the house. Subject#2: Welshman, age approximately 50-60. Called me over and flicked the fly at me while swearing in Welsh. Then he started sipping his beer as if nothing happened. Tuesday:Subject#3: Irishman, age approximately 65. Was so drunk that he didn't notice the fly, gulping it down with the beer, then ordered another jus' da same. obliged him. Four more flies later, he settled his tab, and made his way out of the bar in less than straight line. Subject#4: American, age approximately 25. Yelled at me to come back, threw the beer in my face, and started bar brawl. Wednesday:Dedicated to repairing bar, no customers. Thursday:Subject#5: Scotsman, age approximately 35. Horrified upon seeing the fly think you know where this is going), picked it out of the beer and screamed at it repeatedly, Spit it out! Spit it out!. For the next beer, he demanded an extra ounce on the house, on account of the fly having drunk some of his previous beer. Subject#6: Canadian, age approximately 25-30. Very quiet. When he paid for his beer, the fly was on the Euro bills and he said, No thank you. You can have the fly back. Friday:Subject#7: German, age approximately 30-40. Demanded to see the manager and complained to her that had dishonoured his fine beverage. Suggested to my manager that was unfit for my job, and that he deserved the most expensive beer we have for free as compensation. Mymanager questioned me about the fly, suspicious. She's smarter than thought, despite her not sleeping with me. She asked me about the brawl on Tuesday, if had done something to set off the American. said it might be possible, but who knows what sets them off? She agreed, but warned me that if anything goes wrong during my shift again, would lose my employee discount. Saturday:Theowner is working today instead of the manager. Since the manager won't sleep with the owner either, he probably doesn't know about the fly incident. Onward with my experiment. Subject#8: Iranian, age approximately 20-50. Saw the fly, then praised Allah for showing him the error of his ways, then left. Theowner didn't want the beer to go to waste, so put it into the refrigerator. He didn't notice the fly. Subject#9: Sudanese refugee, age 42. For some reason my knowing his age was important, like he was bragging. gave him the beer that the owner put in the fridge. When he saw the fly, he started yelling loudly that he shouldn't be treated this way, that he should get the same as everyone else. The owner came over to see what was going on. He asked me why was treating the refugee differently, said that wasn't, that had been putting flies in most of the beers. He laughed and repeated this to the refugee, who spluttered and swore on his way out the door. Whyare you putting flies in the beer?, asked the owner. told him about my experiment, minus the bar brawl. Obviously. Well,it's just beer, the cretins, they should have wine like us French. They deserve it, he replied, but don't do it too much. don't want to lose too many customers. Isaid, I'm only doing it to foreigners, but it would be interesting to see the reaction of fellow Frenchman, if ever one orders beer. Don'tyou dare put fly in the wine!, growled the owner. Of,course Monsieur, would never stoop so low! Saturday:Subject#10: dark coloured American woman, age approximately 20-30. broke my no women rule for her because she was extremely rude when innocently asked her to the back room. When she saw the fly, she started screaming in some version of English that couldn't understand, threw the beer at the owner (who came in specifically today to watch my experiment), jumped over the bar and hit me over the head with the beer stein. She and her other young dark coloured American friends then started rampaging, smashing everything in sight. After what seemed like an eternity, they grabbed what few bottles were left unbroken and the cash from the cash box, before running out into the street. Sunday:Thebar owner is in the hospital bed beside mine. He says that he has been telling me repeatedly that am fired, but keep forgetting it because of my head injury. That'sthough, love yelling it at you!	You're fired you damn fool!

Jay Leno Joke .  Two hunters are out and about in the bush when they suddenly approach hole in the ground. The hole is pitch-black dark and they debate between themselves, how deep it might be? Quickly, one of them takes out used bullet shell from his pocket and throws it into the hole. Nothing, they fail to hear it drop. The other hunter notices there's an anvil just by the hole and directs the other to help him lift and throw it into the hole. After considerable effort and at great expense of their backs, they manage to throw the anvil into the hole, but again are disappointed to not hear it hit the bottom. They stand over the hole, with their hands on their knees, squatting over to try and see if there's bottom. Behind them there's noise, some sound of trampling leaves and breaking branches in the bush. One hunter quickly grabs the other as goat seemingly out of nowhere darts between them and straight into the hole. The hunters totally confused decide that it's time to get out of there and call it day. As they head over to their truck parked on the side of long narrow road there comes farmer yelling Becky?? Becky?? and approaches the hunters to ask: hey have either of you seen goat roaming around. One of the hunters replies: Yes, in fact we saw it jump into this hole and points in the direction of the bush where they just came from. The farmer replies: that's impossible, had her tied an anvil.	\>>>> Iheard this joke told by Jay Leno on podcast deconstructing what makes for an effective joke<<<<

He didn't know what to do because he knew nothing about fixing cars. mental patient who was watering some flowers saw the scene and walks towards the man. The man seeing the mental patient coming his way, gets scared and stays quiet in the car. The madman tells the man..- Goodnight my friend. Do you want me to fix your car? ... Since there was anything he can do the man allows the mental patient to check his car. After few minutes the car was as good as new. The man couldn't believe it .. he says Thanks man. You're master in mechanics. How are you locked up in mental institution? ... That's nothing, I'm also an electrical engineer, master in computers and speak languages .... the man still amazed, replies Listen I'm psychiatrist, will get you out of here tomorrow ... Thanks says the mental patient. The man gets in his car and starts driving, few seconds later, brick coming his way at high speed, breaks the back windshield, hits the man in the back of the head so hard that makes the man break the front windshield with his forehead. The man, bleeding profusely, with pieces of glass in his head and face, stops the car, and slowly looks backwards.	He sees the mental patient in the middle of the road who yells:- Don'tyou forget.

Macaroni and Beef .  This is not original, and not me, it is actually quite old (at least 1996) but have not seen it here so here goes... Macaroniand Beef Acouple of weeks ago we decided to cruise out to Ryan's Steakhouse for dinner. It was Wednesday night which means that macaroni and beef was on the hot bar, indeed the only night of the week that it is served. Wednesday night is also kid's night at Ryan's, complete with Dizzy the Clown wandering from table to table entertaining the little bastards. Itmay seem that the events about to be told have little connection to those two circumstances, but all will be clear in moment. Wewent through the line and placed our orders for the all-you-can-eat hot bar then sat down as far away from the front of the restaurant as possible in order to keep the density of kids down bit. Then started my move to the hot bar. Plate after plate of macaroni and beef were consumed that evening, tell you -- in all, four heaping plates of the pseudo- Italianambrosia were shoved into my belly. was sated. Perhaps bit too much, however. Ihad not really been feeling well all day, what with bit of gas and such. By the time had eaten four overwhelmed plates of food, was in real trouble. There was so much pressure on my diaphragm that was having trouble breathing. At the same time, the downward pressure was building. At first, thought it was only gas which could have been passed in batches right at the table without too much concern. Unfortunately,that was not to be. After minute or so it was clear that was dealing with explosive diarrhea. It's amazing how grease can make its way through your intestines far faster than the food which spawned the grease to begin with, but digress... Entering,saw two sinks immediately inside the door, two urinals just to the right of the sinks, and two toilet stalls against the back wall. One of them was handicapped bathroom. Now, normally would have gone to the handicapped stall since like to stretch out bit when take good shit, but in this case, the door lock was broken and the only thing hate worse than my wife telling me to stop cutting my toenails with pair of diagonal wire cutters is having someone walk in on me while am taking shit. went to the normal stall. In retrospect, probably should have gone to the large, handicapped stall even though the door would not lock because that bit of time lost in making the stall switch proved to be bit too long under the circumstances. By the time had walked into the regular stall, the pressure on my ass was reaching Biblical proportions. began The Move. Forthose women who may be reading this, let me take moment to explain The Move. Men know exactly what their bowels are up to at any given second. And when the time comes to empty the cache, sequence of physiological events occur that can not be stopped under any circumstances. There is move men make that involves simultaneously approaching the toilet, beginning the body turn to position ones ass toward said toilet, hooking ones fingers into ones waistline, and pulling down the pants while beginning the squat at the same time. It is very fluid motion that, when performed properly, results in the flawless expulsion of shit at the exact same second that ones ass is properly placed on the toilet seat. Done properly, it even assures that the choad is properly inserted into the front rim of the toilet in the event that the piss stream lets loose at the same time; it is truly picture of coordination rivaling that of ballet dancer. Iwas about half-way into The Move when looked down at the floor and saw pile of vomit that had been previously expelled by one of those little bastards attending kids night; it was mounded up in the corner so did not notice it when had first walked into the stall. Normally, would not have been bothered by such thing, but had eaten so much and the pressure upward was so intense, that hit rarely experienced gag reflex. And once that reflex started, combined with the intense pressure upward caused by the bloated stomach, four plates of macaroni and beef started coming up for rematch. What happened next was so quick that the exact sequence of events are bit fuzzy, but will try to reconstruct them as best can. Inthat moment of impending projectile vomiting, my attention was diverted from the goings-on at the other end. To put freeze frame on the situation, was half crouched down to the toilet, pants pulled down to my knees, with load of vomit coming up my esophagus. Now, most of you know that vomiting takes precedence over shit no matter what is about to come slamming out of your ass. It is apparently an evolutionary thing since shitting will not kill you, but vomiting takes presence of mind to accomplish so that you do not aspirate any food into the bronchial tubes and perhaps choke to death. My attention was thus diverted. At that very split second, my ass exploded in what can only be described as wake...you know, as in newspaper headline along the lines of 30,000 Killed in Wake of Typhoon Fifi or something similar. In what seemed to be most suitably measured in cubic feet, an enormous plug of shit the consistency of thick mud with embedded pockets of greasy liquid came flying out of my ass. But remember, was only half-way down on the toilet at that moment. The shit wave was of such force and of just such an angle in relation to the back curve of the toilet seat that it ricocheted off the back of the seat and slammed into the wall at an angle of incidence equal to the angle at which it initially hit the toilet seat. Then sat down. Recall that when that event occurred, was already half-way to sitting anyway and had actually reached the point of no return. have always considered myself as relatively stable gravitationally, but when you get beyond certain point, you're going down no matter how limber you may be. Needless to say, the shit wave, though of considerable force, was not so sufficient so as to completely glance off the toilet seat and deposit itself on the walls, unlike what you would see when hitting puddle with high-pressure water hose; even though you throw water at the puddle, the puddle gets moved and no water is left to re-form puddle. There was significant amount of shit remaining on about one third of the seat rim which had now just collapsed upon. Now, back to the vomit... Whileall the shitting was going on, the vomit was still on its way up. By the time had actually collapsed on the toilet, my mouth had filled up with goodly portion of the macaroni and beef had just consumed. so what does the human body instinctively do when vomiting? One bends over. So bent over. was still sitting on the toilet, though. Therefore, bending over resulted in me placing my head above my now slightly opened legs, positioned in between my knees and waist. Also directly above my pants which were now pulled down to point just midway between my knees and my ankles. Oh, did mention that was wearing not just pants, but sweat pants with elastic on the ankles. In one mighty push, some three pounds of macaroni and beef, two or three Cokes, and couple of Big, Fat Yeast Rolls were deposited in my pants...on the inside...with no ready exit at the bottom down by my feet. Inthe next several seconds, there were handful of farts, couple of turds, and the event ended, yet was now sitting there with my pants full of vomit, my back covered in shit that had bounced off the toilet, spattered on three ceramic tiled walls to height of about five feet, and still had enough force to come back at me, covering the back of my shirt with droplets of liquid shit. All while thick shit was spread all over my ass in ring curiously in the shape of toilet seat. And there was no fucking toilet paper. Whatcould do but laugh. must have sounded like complete maniac to the guy who then wandered into the bathroom. He actually asked if was since was laughing so hard must have sounded like was crying hysterically. calmed down just enough to ask him if he would get the manager. And told him to have the manager bring some toilet paper. When the manager walked in, he brought the toilet paper with him, but in no way was prepared for what happened next. simply told him that there was no way was going to explain what was happening in the stall, but that needed several wet towels and needed him to go ask my wife to come help me. told him where we were sitting and he left. At that point, think he was probably assuming that had pissed just bit in my pants or something similarly benign. Abouttwo minutes later, my wife came into the bathroom not knowing what was wrong and with certain amount of worry in her voice. explained to her (still laughing and having trouble getting out words) that had slight accident and needed her help. Knowing that had experienced some close calls in the past, she probably assumed that had laid down small turd or something and just needed to bring the car around so we could bolt immediately. Until asked her, I'm sure she had no idea that she was about to go across the street and purchase me new underwear, new socks, new pants, new shirt, and (by that time due to considerable leakage around the elastic ankles thingies) new sneakers. And she then started to laugh herself since was still laughing. Shebegan to ask for an explanation as to what had happened when promised her that would tell her later, but that just needed to handle damage control for the time being. She left. Themanager then came back in with half dozen wet towels and few dry ones. asked him to also bring mop and bucket upon which he assured me that they would clean up anything that needed to be cleaned. Without giving him specific details, explained that what was going on in that stall that night was far in excess of what would expect anyone to deal with, what with most of the folks working at Ryan's making minimum wage of just slightly above. Atthat moment, think it dawned on him exactly the gravity of the situation. Then that manager went so far above the call of duty that will be eternally grateful for his actions. He hooked up hose. Fortunately, commercial bathrooms are constructed with tile walls and tile floors and have drain in the middle of the room in order to make clean up easy. Fortunately, was in commercial bathroom. He hooked up the hose to the spigot located under the sink as began cleaning myself up with the wet towels. Just as was finishing, my wife got back with the new clothes and passed them into the stall, whereupon stuffed the previously worn clothing into the plastic bag that came from the store, handing the bag to my wife. finished cleaning myself off and carefully put on my new clothes, still stuck in the stall since figured that it would be in bad taste to go out of the stall to get redressed in the event happened to be standing there naked and some little bastard kid walked in. At that point, had only made mess; had not yet committed felony and intended to keep it that way. Whenfinished getting dressed, picked up the hose and cleaned up the entire stall, washing down the remains toward the drain in the center of the room. put down the hose and walked out of the bathroom. had intended to go to the manager and thank him for all he had done, but when walked out, three of the management staff were there to greet me with standing ovation. started laughing so hard that thought was going to throw up again, but managed to scurry out to the car where my wife was now waiting to pick me up by the front door. The upshot of all this is that strongly recommend eating dinner at Ryan's Steak House.	They have, by far, the nicest management staff of any restaurant in which have eaten.

Young King Arthur .  Young King Arthur was ambushed and imprisoned by the monarch of neighboring kingdom. The monarch could have killed him but was moved by Arthur's youth and ideals. So, the monarch offered him his freedom, as long as he could answer very difficult question. Arthur would have year to figure out the answer and, if after year, he still had no answer, he would be put to death. The question?.... Whatdo women really want? Such question would perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and to young Arthur, it seemed an impossible query. But, since it was better than death, he accepted the monarch's proposition to have an answer by year's end. He returned to his kingdom and began to poll everyone: the princess, the priests, the wise men and even the court jester. He spoke with everyone, but no one could give him satisfactory answer. Many people advised him to consult the old witch, for only she would have the answer. Butthe price would be high; as the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged. The last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no choice but to talk to the witch. She agreed to answer the question, but he would have to agree to her price first The old witch wanted to marry Sir Lancelot, the most noble of the Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend! YoungArthur was horrified. She was hunchbacked and hideous, had only one tooth, smelled like sewage, made obscene noises, etc. He had never encountered such repugnant creature in all his life. He refused to force his friend to marry her and endure such terrible burden; but Lancelot, learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur. He said nothing was too big of sacrifice compared to Arthur's life and the preservation of the Round Table. Hence, wedding was proclaimed and the witch answered Arthur's question thus: Whatwoman really wants, she answered....is to be in charge of her own life. Everyonein the kingdom instantly knew that the witch had uttered great truth and that Arthur's life would be spared. And so it was, the neighboring monarch granted Arthur his freedom and Lancelot and the witch had wonderful wedding. The honeymoon hour approached and Lancelot, steeling himself for horrific experience, entered the bedroom. But, what sight awaited him. The most beautiful woman he had ever seen lay before him on the bed. The astounded Lancelot asked what had happened The beauty replied that since he had been so kind to her when she appeared as witch, she would henceforth, be her horrible deformed self only half the time and the beautiful maiden the other half. Whichwould he prefer? Beautiful during the day....or night? Lancelot pondered the predicament. During the day, beautiful woman to show off to his friends, but at night, in the privacy of his castle, an old witch Or, would he prefer having hideous witch during the day, but by night, beautiful woman for him to enjoy wondrous intimate moments? What would do? WhatLancelot chose is below. choice before you scroll down below. Noble Lancelot said that he would allow to make the choice herself. Upon hearing this, she announced that she would be beautiful all the time because he had respected her enough to let her be in charge of her own life.	Now...what is the moral to this story?< ScrollDown> The moral is: If you don't let woman have her own way, things are going to get ugly...

The Three- LeggedPig .  An insurance salesman decides to make one last cold call on his country route and winds up way in the back country at the end of dirt road. He drives up to the farm, gets out of the car with his briefcase, and walks up to the door. On his way, he glances at the fenced in area attached to the barn where he sees large hog staring at him. He does classic double-take as it registers on him that this pig only has legs. Heknocks on the door and an old farmer in overalls answers. Howdy, sir, I'm working with United Insurance and I'm here---well doggone it, just gotta ask you first: noticed your pig only has three legs. What's the story? Thefarmer spits and say, Well, you see, few years back my wife left the stove on at night. The flame caught greasy napkin and while we were sleeping the kitchen caught fire and the house filled with smoke. Of course, we never would have known that except for that pig. That pig must've smelled the smoke, hopped the fence, busted into the house and damned if he didn't drag me, the missus, my youngest son, and the cat out of our beds and onto the front lawn. Firemen showed up and doused it before the whole house went up but that pig saved our lives. Andthat's how he lost his leg? Saving you? Nah,that wasn't it. See about year ago--this is about year after the fire--a couple desperate fellas broke out of prison and stole car. The cops were hot on their tail but these two lost 'em and headed out as far into the sticks as they could. They pulled up here at the farm. These two tied us all up, grabbed all our money and belongings and were arguing about how to kill us when that pig busts right through the barn door, launches himself at the first con knocking him out. He grabbed the guy's gun in his mouth, aimed it at the second one and darned if he didn't stare that second one down so bad he dropped his gun and surrendered to the pig. The pig frees us and we called the cops who hauled them both back to jail. Sothe pig--he lost his leg in the tussle? Naw,not then. No, about six months ago--about April--we were doing our taxes. We'd had couple bad years with crops and such and we just couldn't see how we could avoid losing the place. We were in terrible place. Now that pig, somehow he gets into the office in the barn, sees all the forms and paperwork. He stayed up all night while were asleep, crunching numbers, shifting figures from one place to the next, discovering few little pockets of savings we forgot about. Well, tell you, was astounded. There on the desk was my tax form and not only were the finances in good enough shape to keep the farm, we got tidy little return to boot. Ok,that's great, but how in the hell did the pig lose his leg doing that?	Oh,it's like this, mister: pig like that you don't eat all at once.

joke told by Ronald Reagan .  Fidel Castro had just started one of his long, boring speeches when an older man in the crowd was heard saying, Peanuts. Popcorn. Cracker Jack. Castrodidn't break his stride but few minutes later, second voice was heard but with the same message, Peanuts. Popcorn. Cracker Jack. Thistime the Bearded One seemed momentarily perturbed, probably wondering why the secret police hadn't already scooped up the disrespectful cur. But he continued the speech. Afew minutes later, yet another voice chimed, Peanuts. Popcorn. Cracker Jack. Thatdid it. The incensed Castro screams out, The next person hear say that -- well, will personally kick his ass all the way to Miami Beach! Atwhich the whole crowd erupted, Peanuts! Popcorn!	Cracker Jack!

One day, Einstein has to speak at an important science conference. .  On the way there, he tells his driver that looks bit like him: I'm sick of all these conferences. always say the same things over and over! Thedriver agrees: You're right. As your driver, attended all of them, and even though don't know anything about science, could give the conference in your place. That's great idea! says Einstein. Let's switch places then! So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it. But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.	The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.

Professional gamer longs to impress girlfriend with his skills .  The gamer began by explaining that being at any given video game is tremendously difficult feat. While the disparity between the average gamer and the very best gamer is lost on the layperson, he assured her that the gap was incredibly vast. The average viewer lacks the capacity to perceive this difference in skill, and indeed, part of being so damn good at what you do is making it look easy and seamless. Honing your craft requires years of dedication, sacrifice, discipline, repetition, strategic ingenuity, clever thinking...in short, you practically have to live and breathe video games. The gamer explained how he had sacrificed multiple friendships in pursuit of this single-minded goal to be the best. He even personally designed practice routines and finger training exercises for whatever he struggled with on particular day, whether it be reaction speed, accuracy of input sequences, precision of movement, etc. At night, he would dream of simulated scenarios that may occur in his games and appropriately respond to them, effectively practicing while sleeping. It was an all-consuming path and his brain was an engine that kept running. Heclaimed that he used to think he was great at video games because he was the best in his neighborhood, and then the best in his circle of friends, but that with the advent of the internet and online games, he quickly realized that his skills were far from the best. He began to study the play of the best gamers who time and time again would prove their mettle on the world stage, bringing home championship after championship. He wasn't delusional enough to continue thinking he was the best, but he was convinced that with enough practice, that could be him one day. Atthis point the girl was rather impressed. That's so funny, never thought of it that way, but guess you're right. It's just like being good at anything else really. It takes lot of practice, smart thinking, fast fingers... I've watched little League of Legends and think it was called... Gold? he corrected her. Come on over to my house and I'll show you what it takes to be great. Soshe followed him to his house, in part excited to see just how good her boyfriend was, but mostly just happy to support him for something he was passionate about. They arrived at his room. He turned on his Xbox. The girl laughed hysterically and left, never to be heard from again. The girl's name?	pcmasterrace

The offer increased to $25 each and the supply of monkeys became so little that it was an effort to even see monkey, let alone catch it! Theman now announced that he would buy monkeys at $50!

So he sent his men around the world, and they came back with three potential options: Japanese samurai, Chinese samurai and Jewish samurai. Theemperor held tryouts to see which was best. First, he brought in the Japanese samurai. As the Japanese samurai strode into the great Hall and approached him, the emperor pulled out box and opened it, and from it flew out single fruit fly.

Next,the emperor brings in the Chinese samurai. Again, as the samurai approaches, he opens the fly box. The Chinese samurai swings his sword and two perfect halves fall to the ground.

An American and Japanese team decided to engage in competitive boat race. .  Both teams practiced hard and long to reach their peak performance. Onthe big day they felt ready. The Japanese won by mile. Afterward, the American team was discouraged by the loss. Morale sagged. Corporate management decided that the reason for the crushing defeat had to be found, so consulting firm was hired to investigate the problem and recommended corrective action. Theconsultant's finding: The Japanese team had eight people rowing and one person steering; the American team had one person rowing and eight people steering. Afteryear of study and millions spent analyzing the problem, the consultant firm concluded that too many people were steering and not enough were rowing on the American team. Soas race day neared again the following year, the American team's management structure was completely reorganized. The new structure: four steering managers, three area steering managers and new performance review system for the person rowing the boat to provide work incentive. Thenext year, the Japanese won by two miles.	Humiliated, the American corporation laid off the rower for poor performance and gave the managers bonus for discovering the problem.

dog] Beatles karaoke .  One night at karaoke, man goes to the mic and tries his hand at soulfelt version of Yesterday by The Beatles, but does such terrible job that he is booed off the stage. Deeply demoralized, he orders pint at the bar as tears of shame well up in his eyes. Anotherpatron notices this man, approaches, places warm hand on his shoulder, and says, think you've captured the spirit of the song perfectly. John would be quite proud. Eyeswidening, the singer looks at his guest, P-- Paul Mc Cartney?!?! ?Paulsmiles and nods. Shh. Now... it's not often that see such loving tribute to my band's music, so tell you what I'm going to do. When we became more famous than Jesus, let's just say that we acquired few divine powers. am going to give you the ability to absolutely crush any Beatles song that you perform in public from here on out, provided you have pint in your hand and drink toast to me beforehand. Incredulous,the guy watches as Paul waves his hand and magicky sparks fly out. With burst of confidence, he toasts Paul and gets back up on the stage, pint in hand. The crowd recognizes him and starts to boo, but as he launches into Norwegian Wood, the crowd is mezmerized by the utter beauty of the performance. Thunderous applause follows. He follows up with another toast to Paul and performance of Revolution, which leaves the crowd absolutely Victorious, he goes home for the night. Dayslater, he tries his luck again at different pub. He orders pint, toasts Paul (wherever he may be), launches into performance of While My Guitar Gently Weeps at the mic, and the crowd can't get enough of it, going absolutely crazy. Beforelong, he has achieved certain degree of fame for this talent of his. He makes his way onto televised talent show. As he is nervously waiting behind stage, he realizes... he doesn't have his pint! The man calls stagehand over and aggressively says, Beer! need beer! There's beer in the green room, right? Uhhh...not beer, sir, the stagehand says, bit frightened. But we do have booze. Damn!What kinds of booze do you have? Ican make you margarita, vodka and Red Bull, or rum and coke. Hrm...make me the vodka and Red Bull. And hurry! It'shis turn to go on stage. Nervously, he toasts Paul with his mixed drink and goes on stage to sing Eleanor Rigby. However, the wrong words come out. He starts crooning, Someone's knockin' at the door. Somebody's ringin' the bell... Themusic stops awkwardly and he starts over. Again, the wrong words come out. When you were young, and your life was an open book... Thecrowd starts to boo. Frantically, the man looks around and lo and behold he sees Paul Mc Cartneysitting in the audience! Paul! You've got to help me!!! What went wrong?!?! Paulshakes his head and points at the drink.	Red Bull gives you Wings.

Stanley was killed in freak explosion in his garage... .  There was nothing Stanley liked better than drinking beer, smoking cigarettes, and hunting. At least twice week, Stanley went out in the woods with his hunting buddies Cletus and Jimmy. They never shot much, but they always had few cases handy and always had good time. They were practically inseparable and were often seen bumbling around town together. Now,one day Stanley was working out in the shed when his lit cigarette ignited nearby gas can. The can exploded, Stanley was engulfed in flames and, tragically, died from his injuries. After the police investigation ruled the explosion an accident, his mangled body was sent to the morgue. The entire front side of his body was burned beyond recognition, but everyone in town knew that if anybody could confirm it was Stanley, it'd be Cletus and Jimmy. Themortician called Cletus in to identify the body. Thank you for coming in, Cletus, she said gently. know this isn't easy for you and appreciate you taking the time. Cletus replied in somber tone. No trouble at all, ma'am. The mortician lifted the sheet from the body, revealing Stanley's horribly burned frontside. She asked Cletus if this was indeed Stanley. Weeeeeeeell,said Cletus. don't know. really can't tell. Why don't you flip him on over? The mortician was confused, but obliged, revealing Stanley's relatively unharmed naked backside. Without hesitation, Cletus exclaimed, Nope, that ain't Stanley! The mortician was surprised, but thanked Cletus again for his time and sent him on his way. Shethen called Jimmy to the morgue to see if he could provide positive identification. As with Cletus, she offered her sympathies and thanked him for coming in. Then she pulled back the sheet and asked Jimmy if he could confirm it was Stanley. Weeeeeeell,Jimmy said pensively. Hard to say. Would it be alright if you flip him over? The mortician was even more surprised this time, but again obliged. After only second, Jimmy said confidently, Nope, that ain't Stanley. The mortician was dumbfounded. Ihave to ask, she said. Why on earth did you want me to flip the body over? Cletus said the exact same thing! Jimmyreplied, Well you see miss, this man's only got one asshole. Oneasshole?! the mortician cried. What's that got to do with anything?!	Weeeeellyou see, said Jimmy, Whenever me and Cletus and Stanley walked through town, everybody would point and say, goes Stanley with them two assholes!'

The audience's excitement calms down, anxious with what could be coming. Severalminutes pass, nothing changes. Some members of the audience begin to express discontent. What'sgoing on? Is there problem? Luckilywith the director in the room watching along, he could soothe their fears. Donot worry my friends, this is all part of the experience! Andso with reassurance by the film's creator, the audience settled down and focused their attention on the screen in anticipation. Several more minutes passed. People were starting to get uncomfortable. Nothing was playing, and the projector had been making strange noises within few minutes of this white screen. Just when people were getting ready to leave, they saw movement. Asmall black speck on the white screen began to move erratically. There was confusion and hushed whispers. What's happening? Is this part of the movie? They all watched with rapt attention as this small fleck bounced around, leaving and coming back from all angles.

Christmas Myth .  After learning about different ways to celebrate Christmas, the children were eager to learn more about the subject. Knowing that one of the teachers at their school was from the and maybe had an angel on top of the tree instead of the classic star, they went to ask him about it. It'slong story he said: It began very, very long time ago. It was cold and snowy day, as it usually is on the North Pole. December was almost halfway passed already, but still, no decoration were in place. The elves couldn't make time to decorate as they were busy making toys. And Father Christmas was in very, very bad mood. So the Christmas angel figured he had to do something to cheer him up so Christmas would be joyful as always. Thus, he cleaned the workshop and the house, tossed out the old take away leftovers and went to look for the decorations. Approaching Father Christmas he asked:\- Whatshould do with these decorations? The angel asked.\- Idon't care, leave me alone! Father Christmas hissed back. Theangel figured he put up the decorations and give Father Christmas another day. Maybe the clean house and the decorations would cheer him up. And the next day the angel went to Father Christmas to ask about how he should organize the Christmas gifts on the sleigh. \- Idon't care, leave me alone! Father Christmas hissed again. The angel, not admitting defeat just yet. He let another day pass and figured he should put up the Christmas tree while he were on it. Not entirely sure where to put it, as it never was in the same spot for two years in row, he meekly approached Father Christmas, hoping he would be in better mood as Christmas was very, very close.\- Wheredo you want the Tree? The angel asked.\- Asfar as I'm concerned ..., said Father Christmas.	You can take the tree and that's the story of how the Christmas angel got on top of the Christmas tree.

The disappearing kitty treat. The cat then went Wow. See that? the man cried. That cat said wow! Thecrowd rolled their eyes. He got few coins in his tip jar for the trick itself. The magician, sensing that the crowd would turn on him, got desperate. Hey Goldie, where does milk come from Thecat then said Cow Thecrowd walked off and groaned. Asthe crowd walked off, the cat said Some cultures drink goat and sheep's milk. We just drink cow's milk in America due to cultural differences. Also, would say the Wu Sangui was former Chinese leader, but few Westerners know of his existence. And didn't want to swear in front of the kids, so said 'wow' The tip jar is this way, folks.

So there was man in Bulgaria who drove trains for living. .  He loved his job. Driving train had been his dream ever since he was child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was little too reckless and caused crash. He made it out, but single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well,at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said failed execution was sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room and the man was once again unharmed. Well,this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. Youknow what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. Theman looked at the executioner and said, Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just bad conductor.

Once upon time there lived beautiful Queen with large breasts .  Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason.

Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made batch of itching powder and poured little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch. TheKing, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as hero. Uponreturning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with laugh told him to get lost. Thenext day, Horatio slipped massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick. Themoral of the story Pay your bills !	!

Once upon time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived young monk named Sam... .  His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below. Samwas particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one. Andon Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... Andthe next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings. Andon it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there. Suddenly,to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam. Thetownsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief. Themayor approached the lead monk of the order. What happened? he asked, exasperated. Theold monk shook his head sadly. Isn't it obvious? he said.	Sam sung Note 7.

Sir,do you have any idea how fast you were going? Also where are you headed to? Ibelieve was doing close to double the speed limit officer. And I'm headed to see me family. replies the Hispanic man. Licenseand registration please says Bob. Ido not have them the Hispanic man admits. Atthis point Bob comes to the conclusion that he is most likely dealing with an illegal immigrant. Albeit the holiday season, despite him not wanting to, Bob took an oath to uphold the law thus he is forced to call Upon arrival they immediately arrest the Hispanic man and he is deported the next day. Bob feels awful. Thenext year Bob is once again scheduled to work around the holiday season and is posted at his favorite roadway. Within the first hour pickup truck flies past him doing easily double the speed limit! Bob immediately turns on his lights, pulls the vehicle over and approaches the drivers window. Much to his surprise it is the same Hispanic man from the year before! Doyou know why pulled you over? Also where are you headed? He asks. TheHispanic man calmly answers. believe was doing double the allowed limit. am headed to see me family Bobis confused and tad flustered at this point. Sirhaven't we met before? Same time last year? Same circumstances? Have you gotten your citizenship straightened out yet? Yes we have met before. Same time last year under the same circumstances indeed. No am still not citizen yet replies the Hispanic man. Bobsighs. Heproceeds to call authorities and once more the Hispanic man is arrested and deported the next day. Bob is puzzled. Forthe third year in row Bob the policeman is scheduled to work around the holiday season. Per usual, he is sitting at his favorite roadway when his eyes behold an all too familiar sight. pickup truck blows past him this time doing triple the allowed limit! Bobsounds his siren, chases the vehicle down, and pulls it over. He runs up to the window only to see the same exact Hispanic man from both years prior! Completelybewildered. Sir this is the third year in row around the same time of year, under the same circumstances! Surely by now you know will be sitting here yet you still come through here speeding! If you would just do the speed limit you would be able to see your family in peace! He exclaims. Well,if don't drive fast enough then I'm afraid won't be able to see them as it is not practical for me to purchase plane ticket. The Hispanic man explains. Sir,am sorry but must contact the authorities once again. I'm afraid you will be arrested and deported for the third year in row. hate to do this. Bob says. No,no, it's quite alright really. Replies the Hispanic man. Stillvery confused, Bob asks. If you don't mind my asking, where exactly is it that your family lives that you must drive so fast to get? TheHispanic man, with the straightest of faces, looks Bob the policeman dead in his eyes, and smoothly answers.	Cuba.

So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for living. .  He loved his job. Driving train had been his dream ever since he was child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was little too reckless and caused crash. He made it out, but single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said failed execution was sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. You know what? No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. Theman looked at the executioner and said, Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.	I'm just bad conductor.

On the bus was man opening his book and settling in for the long journey ahead. After only few minutes into the ride, *yap yap yap* noise came from the seats behind him. The yapping continued until, fed up, the man jumped up and scowled over the seat to the woman behind him and her yapping dog. He bellows, Can you please quiet your dog! The woman returns his scowl with one of her own and says No! will not silence my pet, it is dog and I'm allowed to have it and dogs yap! Mind your own business! The man returns to his side of the seat and opens his window in hopes the fresh air helps calm him, and the sound of the wind drowns out the annoying yaps. *yap yap yap* The man lights up cigar and begins to smoke. Taking long pulls and blowing the smoke making sure it's blown directly in the woman's direction. Hefeels tap on his shoulder. The woman from the seat behind him is standing over his seat and coughing, she says: put that out! It's making me and my dog cough! No!will not. am allowed to have it! Mind your own business! he says with wry smile. Thewoman angrily grabs the cigar and throws it out of the bus window. Then the man angrily stands up, grabs the dog and throws it out of the window.
