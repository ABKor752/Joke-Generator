Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground. Thepoliceman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know. Afterabout half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is. So,as the couple passes, he says to them, Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?

married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. .  Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented new machine that would transfer portion of the mother's labor pain to the baby's father. He was asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it. The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. However, as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point, they decided to try out for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer all the pain to him. The wife delivered healthy baby with virtually no pain. She and her husband were ecstatic.	When they got home, the mailman was dead on the porch.

This snake could perform any surgery that exists. The tortoise explains the situation to the snake and asks him if there's anything the snake can do for the frog.' Yessssss,'the snake replies. issss one sssurgery can perform that may ressstore your friend'sss voice, but you have to undersssstand, it's very risssky. There'sss fifty percent chance your friend won't sssurvive the sssurgery.' my,' says the tortoise. be sure to let him know!' So the tortoise returns to the frog and tells him the news. this snake who might be able to restore your voice, but it's coin toss whether or not you survive the procedure. Do you want to go through with this?' After long pause, the frog blinks once for Yes. So day is set aside for the surgery and on that day all of the creatures of the forest gather around the snake and the frog as the snake prepares his tools and the anesthesia starts to kick in.
