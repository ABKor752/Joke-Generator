A guy walks into a bar with an octopus. He sits the octopus down on a stool and tells everyone in the bar that this is a very talented octopus. He can play any musical instrument in the world. He hears everyone in the crowd laughing at him, calling him an idiot, etc. So he says that he will wager $50 to anyone who has an instrument that the octopus can't play.A guy walks up with a guitar and sets it beside the octopus. The octopus starts playing better than Jimi Hendrix, just rippin' it up. So the man pays his $50. Another guy walks up with a trumpet. The octopus plays the trumpet better than Dizzie Gillespie. So the man pays his $50. Then a Scotsman walks up with bagpipes. He sits them down and the octopus fumbles with it for a minute and sits it down with a confused look.Ha! the Scot says. Can't you play it?The octopus looks up at him and says, Play it?	I'm going to fuck it as soon as I figure out how to get its pajamas off.

A woman on a train is refusing to let a tired soldier sit down. An American soldier, serving in World War II had just returned from several weeks of battle on the German front lines.The soldier had been granted rest and relaxation and was on a train that was bound for London.The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train in hopes of finding an empty seat.The only empty seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged English lady and was being used by her little dog.The weary soldier asked, Please ma'am, may I sit in that seat?The English woman looked down her nose at the solider and sniffed then said, You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see that my little pooch is using that seat?The soldier walked away, looking if there were any other unoccupied seats to use, but after another trip down to the end of the train, he found himself facing the woman with the dog again.Again, the soldier asked, Please lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired.The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted out loud, You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also extremely arrogant!The soldier didn't say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog and tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.The Woman, at a loss for words; shrieked, railed and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.An English gentlemen sitting across the aisle spoke up and said, You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing.	You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand, you drive your autos on the wrong side of the road and now, sir, you've thrown the wrong bitch out the window!.

He walks in, orders a mug of beer and starts talking to the bartender:I have been in a coma for quite a long time. I don't know what's going on in the world. How is our country doing?Can't be better! says the bartender happily. We are the mightiest nation in the world, we no longer have ANY external threats! All political issues have been resolved!

The husband leans over and asks his wife. Do you remember the first time we had sex together over fifty years ago? We went behind the village tavern where you leaned against the back fence and I made love to you.Yes, she says, I remember it well.OK, he says, How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.So, as the couple passes, he says to them, Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together.	Is there some sort of secret to this?Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence.

A small boy asks his Dad, Dad, what are politics? Dad says, Well son, let me try to explain it this way: I'm the breadwinner of the family, so let's call me Capitalism. Your mom, she's the administrator of the money, so we'll call her the Government. We're here to take care of your needs, so we'll call you the People. The nanny, we'll consider her the Working Class. And your baby brother, we'll call him the Future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense. So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. The little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father having sex with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now. The father says, Good, son, tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about.	The little boy replies, Well, while Capitalism is screwing the Working Class, the Government is sound asleep, the People are being ignored and the Future is in Deep Shit.

50 dollars is 50 dollars. Every year for 45 years James and Lucille had gone to the state Fair. Every yearJames told Lucille he wanted to go on the helicopter flight. Its only 50 dollars he would say. Every year Lucille would say 50 dollars is fifty dollars and that was the end of the discussion.On their 46th trip to the state Fair James asked to go on the helicopter flight, and Lucille told him that 50 dollars was still 50 dollars.The helicopter pilot heard their conversation and felt a bit sorry for James. He approached them and told them that he would give them both a ride for free if neither one said a word for the whole flight. If either one said a single word he would charge them the 50 dollars. James and Lucille agree.The pilot takes off and climbs as fast as he can and immediately goes into a dive, but he doesn't hear a word from the couple. He flys in circles, climbs and dives, zigs, zags, and everything in between. The couple never say a word. Finally he lands the helicopter.Over the head set he says I'm really impressed.	I did every thing I could to get a reaction from you two.James says well, I almost told you to stop when Lucille fell out, but hey, 50 doolars is 50 dollars.
The world's leading expert on European wasps walks into a record shop. He asks the assistant Do you have 'European Vespidae Acoustics Volume 2? I believe it was released this week. Certainly, replies the assistant. Would you like to listen before you buy it? That would be wonderful, says the expert, and puts on a pair of headphones. He listens for a few moments and says to the assistant, I'm terribly sorry, but I am the world's leading expert on European wasps and this is not accurate at all. I don't recognize any of those sounds. Are you sure this is the correct recording? The assistant checks the turntable, and replies that it is indeed European Vespidae Acoustics Volume 2. The assistant apologizes and lifts the needle onto the next track. Again the expert listens for a few moments and then says to the assistant, No, this just can't be right! I've been an expert in this field for 43 years and I still don't recognize any of these sounds. The assistant apologizes again and lifts the needle to the next track. The expert throws off the headphones as soon as it starts playing and is fuming with rage. This is outrageous false advertising! I am the world's leading expert on European wasps and no European wasp has ever made a sound like the ones on this record!The manager of the shop overhears the commotion and walks over.What seems to be the problem, sir?This is an outrage! I am the world's leading expert on European wasps. Nobody knows more about them than I do. There is no way in hell that the sounds on that record were made by European wasps! The manager glances down and notices the problem instantly.I'm terribly sorry, sir.	It appears we've been playing you the bee side.

A married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine that would transfer a portion of the mother's labor pain to the baby's father. He was asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it. The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. However, as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point, they decided to try out for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer all the pain to him. The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain. She and her husband were ecstatic.	When they got home, the mailman was dead on the porch.

A fifteen year-old boy came home with a Porsche.  and his parents began to yell and scream,Where did you get that car?He calmly told them, I bought it today.With what money? demanded his parents.We know what a Porsche costs..Well, said the boy, this one cost me fifteen dollars.So the parents began to yell even louder. Who would sell a car like that for fifteen dollars? they asked.It was the lady up the street, said the boy. Don't know her name-they just moved in. She saw me ride past on my bike and asked me if I wanted to buy a Porsche for fifteen dollars.Oh my Goodness!, moaned the mother, she must be a child abuser. Who knows what she will do next? John, you go right up there and see what's going on.So the boy's father walked up the street to the house where the lady lived and found her out in the yard calmly planting petunias. He introduced himself as the father of the boy to whom she had sold a Porsche for fifteen dollars and demanded to know why she did it.Well, she said, this morning I got a phone call from my husband. I thought he was on a business trip, but learned from a friend he has run off to Hawaii with his secretary and really doesn't intend to come back. He claimed he was stranded and asked me to sell his new Porsche and send him the money.	So I did.

Once again, St. Peter shows up and with him is another extremely ugly woman. He chains the woman to the second guy saying, Your punishment for stepping on a duck is to spend eternity chained to this ugly woman!The third guy has observed all this and as he really doesn't want to be chained to an ugly woman for eternity, he's extremely careful where he steps.Indeed, he manages to go months without stepping on any ducks. One day though, St.Peter appears with the most gorgeous woman the guy has ever laid eyes on.	She's tall, curvaceous, tanned and extremely sexy.Without a word, St. Peter chains the woman to the third guy.The guy happily says to the woman, I wonder what I did to deserve being chained to you for all eternity?The woman replies, I don't know about you, but I stepped on a duck.

[Long] Two men are walking across a field, when they come across a very large hole in the ground. So large that they can't see the bottom of this hole. I wonder how deep it is., the first man says. The second man pulls out a coin, and flips it into hole. They wait and listen.... ....nothing. Wow!, they both exclaim. Let's try something else., says one man to the other. They spot a large rock nearby, and with a struggle, they get the rock to the hole. They roll it in, wait and listen....still nothing. My goodness! How deep this hole must be!, says one man. Let's try that huge log over there., says the other. Again, with a struggle, they haul this huge log to the hole, and roll it in. As they wait and listen, and seemingly out of nowhere, a goat runs up and jumps in the hole. As they both look at each other in shock, they hear a tractor coming across the field. Shortly, a farmer arrives, and asks,  Either of you boys seen my goat?. Yeah!, they both exclaim. One just came by and jumped in this hole! The farmer sits back and tells them, No, no.

Still my favorite joke I ever made up. :) A monocle walks into a bar. After a few drinks he starts to feel pretty good (and a little uncoordinated). He reaches for a cigarette, but the bartender stops him. Sorry, buddy, but due to city ordinances we don't allow smoking in here. You'll have to step outside to smoke.So the monocle hops off the bar stool and grabs his cigarettes to head outside. Meanwhile a second monocle emerges from the bathroom. They bump into each other as they cross paths and fall to the floor, hopelessly entangled. They try to get free but the more they struggle, the more tangled they become.The bartender looks down on this travesty and shakes his head. Hey you two! he shouts.	Stop making spectacles of yourselves!
Two priests are in a shower. They undress and step into the showers before they realize there is no soap.Father John says he has soap in his room and goes to get it, not bothering to dress.He grabs two bars of soap, one in each hand, while he is halfway down the hall when he sees three newly inducted nuns from other city heading his way.Having no place to hide, he stands against the wall and freezes like he's a statue.The nuns stop and comment on how life-like he looks.The first nun suddenly reaches out and pulls on his manhood.Startled, he drops a bar of soap.Oh look says the first nun, it's a soap dispenser.To test her theory the second nun also pulls on his manhood. Sure enough, he drops the second bar of soap.Now the third nun decides to have a go. She pulls once, then twice, and three times but nothing happens.So she gives several more tugs, then yells:Holy Mary, Mother of God!	LIQUID SOAP TOO!

A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship. . The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink. They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank.Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore.

Should English be the only official language of the EU? The European Commission has just announced an agreement whereby English will be the official language of the European Union rather than German, which was the other possibility. As part of the negotiations, the British Government conceded that English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a 5- year phase-in plan that would become known as Euro-English. ---In the first year, s will replace the soft c. Sertainly, this will make the sivil servants jump with joy. The hard c will be dropped in favour of k. This should klear up konfusion, and keyboards kan have one less letter.There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year when the troublesome ph will be replaced with f. This will make words like fotograf 20% shorter. ---In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible.Governments will enkourage the removal of double letters which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the horibl mes of the silent e in the languag is disgrasful and it should go away. ---By the 4th yer peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing th with z and w with v.

An American spy is in Soviet Russia, digging up information on a powerful Russian politician. He finds him in a bar, walks in dressed in Russian attire, pretending to be Russian.

I am the proudest Soviet there is! I can sing the anthem more beautifully than any other man in the country!He then proceeds to sing the Soviet anthem, so melodically and beautifully, that everybody in the bar cheers.Very good, very good! says the politician. But I still think you are spy.The man continues to keep his cool. I am a historian! I can tell you everything about this glorious country!. He then spends about two hours recounting the Revolution, the Great Patriotic War, about how superior to the Russia is in terms of technology compared to America and makes a great argument about how communism is beneficial to society.Amazing! You are skilled! says the politician. The spy smirks. But I still think you American spy. The spy is getting frustrated, but still unfazed. He replies, I am good drinker, a true Russian! Let us drink, and see who can come out top!The bar turns its attention to the politician and the spy, who are now in a drinking contest.The bartender serves drink after drink of vodka.

I am an American.	But what made you think that way, after all this time?The Russian politician replies, There aren't many black people in Russia.
A frog is born mute.  so he can't make any noises that a frog typically makes because, well, he can't make any noises at all. So naturally it's very difficult for the frog to make friends with the other frogs and he ends up with just one friend; a tortoise who's had the patience and the wherewithal to befriend this mute frog and to develop a system of communication with him. Basically the frog blinks once for Yes, twice for No, the tortoise does all the talking and asks all the questions and they get along just fine. Years go by and the frog and the tortoise have fostered a beautiful friendship. But as the frog has gotten older he has become sexually curious and desires to mingle with the other frogs his age. The tortoise senses this one day and asks the frog, 'do you want me to take you to the pond?' The frog blinks once for Yes. So the tortoise takes the frog to the pond and starts introducing him to all the other frogs. At first the frog is very nervous but the tortoise does a great job of explaining his disability and all the other frogs are very accepting of his condition. The mute frog ends up making a lot of new friends which boosts his confidence. And then the frog spies across the pond a beautiful girl frog. He can't take his eyes off of her and the tortoise catches him staring. The tortoise says, 'You like her, don't you?' The frog blinks once. The tortoise says, 'You want me to go talk to her for you?' The frog blinks twice for No. 'I see,' says the tortoise. 'You wish you could talk to her yourself.' The frog blinks once, a single tear rolling down his little frog cheek. 'Well gee, my friend,' says the tortoise. 'We've been good friends for so long, I think I owe it to you to find a way to restore your voice.' And with that the tortoise sets out.The tortoise searches all over the forest for days until one day he meets a snake who just so happened to be the most renowned surgeon of all the land. This snake could perform any surgery that exists. The tortoise explains the situation to the snake and asks him if there's anything the snake can do for the frog. 'Yessssss,' the snake replies. 'There issss one sssurgery I can perform that may ressstore your friend'sss voice, but you have to undersssstand, it's very risssky. There'sss a fifty percent chance your friend won't sssurvive the sssurgery.' 'Oh my,' says the tortoise. 'I'll be sure to let him know!' So the tortoise returns to the frog and tells him the news. 'There's this snake who might be able to restore your voice, but it's a coin toss whether or not you survive the procedure. Do you want to go through with this?' After a long pause, the frog blinks once for Yes. So a day is set aside for the surgery and on that day all of the creatures of the forest gather around the snake and the frog as the snake prepares his tools and the anesthesia starts to kick in. All the creatures of the forest look on anxiously, knowing that in just a few short moments they're either going to hear their friend's voice for the first time, or they're going to lose him forever. And you'll never guess what happened next.	He croaked!

No Sex Tonight! I've never quite figured out why the sexual urges of men and women differ so much.And I never have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing or why men think with their head and women with their heart.For example… One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed.Well, the passion started to heat up, but then she said I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.I said WHAT??!! What was that? !So she said the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear...You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.She responded to my puzzled look by saying, Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.The very next day, I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, high-end department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.Let me tell you...she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a tsunami. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. But, I think I threw her for a loop when I said, That's fine, honey.She appeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement.	Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, I think this is all dear; let's go to the cashier.I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, No honey, I don't feel like it.Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, WHAT?I then said Honey, I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while.You're just not in touch with my financial means as a man, enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?Apparently, no sex tonight either!Edit: Didn't expect to make front page but glad lots of you got a laugh out of it!Edit 2: Thank you for the gold!

On the outskirts of a small town, there was a big, old pecan tree just inside the cemetery fence. One day, two boys filled up a bucketful of nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts.  One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me, said one boy. Several dropped and rolled down toward the fence.Another boy came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate. Sure enough, he heard, One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me ....He just knew what it was. He jumped back on his bike and rode off. Just around the bend, he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along.Come here quick, said the boy, you won't believe what I heard! Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls!The man said, Beat it, kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk. When the boy insisted though, the man hobbled slowly to the cemetery.Standing by the fence they heard, One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me.The old man whispered, Boy, you've been tellin' me the truth. Let's see if we can see the Lord...? Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the Lord.At last, they heard, One for you, one for me. That's all.	Now let's go get those nuts by the fence and we'll be done....They say the old man had the lead for a good half-mile before the kid on the bike passed him.

This guy walks into a quiet bar.  He is carrying three ducks, one in each hand, and one under his left arm. He places them on the bar. He has a few drinks and chats with the bartender. The bartender is experienced, and has learned not to ask people about the animals that they bring into the bar, so he doesn't mention the ducks. They chat for about 30 minutes before the guy with the ducks has to go to the restroom. The ducks are left on the bar. The bartender is alone with the ducks. There is an awkward silence. The bartender decides to try to make some conversation. What's your name? He says to the first duck. Huey replies the first duck. How's your day been, Huey? Great. Lovely day. Had a ball. Been in and out of puddles all day. Oh. That's nice, says the Bartender. Then he says to the second duck Hi, and what's your name? Dewey, came the answer. So how's your day been, Dewey? Great. Lovely day. Had a ball. Been in and out of puddles all day. If I had the chance another day I would do the same again. So the bartender turns to the third duck and says, So, you must be Louie.

A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak. After mass he asked the monsignor for help. The monsignor replied, When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass. If I start to get nervious I take a sip. So the next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm.

A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon.... A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away. The distressed woman wailed, Are you sure?Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead, replied the vet.. How can you be so sure? she protested. I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something. The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat satback on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. The vet looked at the woman and said, I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck. The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. $150! she cried, $150 just to tell me my duck is dead!The vet shrugged, I'm sorry.	If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $150.
A Chinese man walks into a bar and sits right next to a Jewish man. The Jewish man starts eyeing the Chinese man suspiciously, a dark expression covering his face. Suddenly, with no warning at all, he stands up, grabs the Chinese man by the neck, smashes his face against the bar and throws him to the floor. The Chinese man, dazed and angry, stands up and confronts the Jewish man. What the fuck is wrong with you?! Why would you do that? !The Jewish man looks him in the eye and says That was for bombing Pearl Harbor.The Chinese man froze. For bombing Pe- but that was the Japanese!! I am Chinese!Japanese, Chinese, Korean, you're all the same to me, said the Jewish man. Dumbfounded, the Chinese man sits at the bar and orders another beer. He keeps eyeing the Jewish man, a dark expression on his face. Suddenly, he grabs his beer mug and smashes it against the Jewish man's face, then proceeds to punch him and kick him until the Jewish man isn't moving any more. He sits back at the bar. After a couple of minutes, the Jewish man struggles to his feet, stumbles to the bar, and confronts the Chinese man. What the fuck was that about?The Chinese man sips his beer, and without looking at the Jewish man, he says That was for sinking the Titanic.Outraged, the Jewish man goes red. Sinking the Ti- that was an iceberg! !The Chinese man shrugs.	They're all the same to me, icebergs, Goldbergs, Rosenbergs, Silberbergs...

A wife came home early and... One day, a wife came home early and found her husband in their bedroom making love to a very attractive young woman. Naturally, she was very upset.You are a disrespectful pig! she cried. How dare you do this to me! I'm a faithful wife, the mother of your children! I'm leaving you. I want a divorce right away!The husband replied, Hang on just a minute love, so at least I can tell you what happened.Go ahead, she sobbed, but they'll be the last words you'll say to me!So the husband began, Well, I was getting into the car to drive home, and this young lady here asked me for a lift. She looked so down and out and defenseless that I took pity on her and let her into the car.I noticed that she was very thin, not well dressed and very dirty. She told me that she hadn't eaten for three days. So, in my compassion, I brought her home and warmed up the enchiladas I made for you last night. The ones you wouldn't eat because you're afraid you'll put on weight. The poor thing devoured them in moments!Since she needed a good clean-up, I suggested a shower, and while she was doing that, I noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes so I threw them away. Then, as she needed clothes, I gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don't wear because you say they are too tight.I also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, which you don't wear because I don't have good taste.	I found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for Christmas that you don't wear just to annoy her and I also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and don't wear because someone at work has a pair the same.The husband took a quick breath and continued, She was so grateful for my understanding and help that as I walked her to the door, she turned to me with tears in her eyes and said… Do you have anything else that your wife doesn't use?

Six Lessons of Life. **Lesson 1:**A man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower when the doorbell rings. The wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs. When she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next door neighbour. Before she says a word, Bob says, I'll give you $800 to drop that towel. After thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of Bob.After a few seconds, Bob hands her $800 dollars and leaves. The woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. When she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks,…Who was that? It was Bob the next door neighbour, she replies. Great! the husband says, Did he say anything about the $800 he owes me? *Moral of the story:*If you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure. **Lesson 2:**A sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. They rub it and a Genie comes out. The Genie says, I'll give each of you just one wish Me first! Me first! says the administration clerk. I want to be in the Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world. Poof! She's gone. Me next! Me next! says the sales rep. I want to be in Hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of Pina Coladas and the love of my life. Poof! He's gone. OK, you're up, the Genie says to the manager. The manager says, I want those two back in the office after lunch. *Moral of the story:*Always let your boss have the first say **Lesson 3:**A priest offered a lift to a Nun. She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg. The priest nearly had an accident. After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. The nun said,Father, remember Psalm 129? The priest removed his hand. But, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again. The nun once again said, Father, remember Psalm 129? The priest apologized Sorry sister but the flesh is weak. Arriving at the convent, the nun went on her way. On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to look up Psalm 129. It said, Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory. *Moral of the story:*If you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity **Lesson 4**A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. A rabbit asked him, Can I also sit like you and do nothing all day long? The crow answered: Sure, why not. So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested.A fox jumped on the rabbit and ate it. *Moral of the story:*To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very high up **Lesson 5:**Power of CharismaA turkey was chatting with a bull I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree, sighed the turkey, but I haven't got the energy. Well, why don't you nibble on my droppings? replied the bull. They're packed with nutrients. The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. Finally after a fourth night, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. Soon he was spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree. *Moral of the story:*Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there **Lesson 6**A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field. While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was. The dung was actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him. *Moral of the story:*1. Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy2. Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend3. And when you're in deep shit, it's best to keep your mouth shut! Edit:1. Thanks for the Platinum/Gold/Silver kind strangers. This is my first time getting each of these and it happened in a single post.2. To all those people saying this is very old, yes, I did pull this out of my stash from 2012.
