married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. .  Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented new machine that would transfer portion of the mother's labor pain to the baby's father. He was asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it. The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. However, as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point, they decided to try out for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer all the pain to him.

married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. .  Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented new machine that would transfer portion of the mother's labor pain to the baby's father. He was asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it. The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. However, as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point, they decided to try out for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer all the pain to him. The wife delivered healthy baby with virtually no pain. She and her husband were ecstatic.	When they returned home, the Mailer had died on the porch.	0.998887836933136

Several dropped and rolled down toward the fence. Anotherboy came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate. Sure enough, he heard, One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me .... Hejust knew what it was. He jumped back on his bike and rode off. Just around the bend, he met an old man with cane, hobbling along. Comehere quick, said the boy, you won't believe what heard! Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls! Theman said, Beat it, kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk. When the boy insisted though, the man hobbled slowly to the cemetery. Standingby the fence they heard, One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me. Theold man whispered, Boy, you've been tellin' me the truth. Let's see if we can see the Lord...? Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get glimpse of the Lord. Atlast, they heard, One for you, one for me. That's all.

These three guys die together in tragic accident and they all go to heaven .  When they get there, St. Peter greets them and tells them, We only have one rule here in heaven. Don't step on the ducks. So,they enter heaven and sure enough, there are ducks all over the place. It'salmost impossible not to step on duck there's so many, and though they try their utmost to avoid standing on them, the first guy soon accidentally steps on one. St.Peter then appears with the ugliest woman the guy had ever seen. St.Peter chains the woman to the guy and says to him, Your punishment for stepping on duck is to spend eternity chained to this ugly woman! Thenext day, the second guy also accidentally steps on duck. Once again, St. Peter shows up and with him is another extremely ugly woman. He chains the woman to the second guy saying, Your punishment for stepping on duck is to spend eternity chained to this ugly woman! Thethird guy has observed all this and as he really doesn't want to be chained to an ugly woman for eternity, he's extremely careful where he steps. Indeed,he manages to go months without stepping on any ducks. One day though, St. Peterappears with the most gorgeous woman the guy has ever laid eyes on. She's tall, curvaceous, tanned and extremely sexy. Withoutword, St. Peter chains the woman to the third guy.

frog is born mute .  frog is born mute so he can't make any noises that frog typically makes because, well, he can't make any noises at all. So naturally it's very difficult for the frog to make friends with the other frogs and he ends up with just one friend; tortoise who's had the patience and the wherewithal to befriend this mute frog and to develop system of communication with him. Basically the frog blinks once for Yes, twice for No, the tortoise does all the talking and asks all the questions and they get along just fine. Years go by and the frog and the tortoise have fostered beautiful friendship. But as the frog has gotten older he has become sexually curious and desires to mingle with the other frogs his age. The tortoise senses this one day and asks the frog, 'do you want me to take you to the pond?' The frog blinks once for Yes. So the tortoise takes the frog to the pond and starts introducing him to all the other frogs. At first the frog is very nervous but the tortoise does great job of explaining his disability and all the other frogs are very accepting of his condition. The mute frog ends up making lot of new friends which boosts his confidence. And then the frog spies across the pond beautiful girl frog. He can't take his eyes off of her and the tortoise catches him staring. The tortoise says, like her, don't you?' The frog blinks once. The tortoise says, want me to go talk to her for you?' The frog blinks twice for No. see,' says the tortoise. wish you could talk to her yourself.' The frog blinks once, single tear rolling down his little frog cheek. gee, my friend,' says the tortoise. been good friends for so long, think owe it to you to find way to restore your voice.' And with that the tortoise sets out. Thetortoise searches all over the forest for days until one day he meets snake who just so happened to be the most renowned surgeon of all the land. This snake could perform any surgery that exists. The tortoise explains the situation to the snake and asks him if there's anything the snake can do for the frog.' Yessssss,'the snake replies. issss one sssurgery can perform that may ressstore your friend'sss voice, but you have to undersssstand, it's very risssky. There'sss fifty percent chance your friend won't sssurvive the sssurgery.' my,' says the tortoise. be sure to let him know!' So the tortoise returns to the frog and tells him the news. this snake who might be able to restore your voice, but it's coin toss whether or not you survive the procedure. Do you want to go through with this?' After long pause, the frog blinks once for Yes. So day is set aside for the surgery and on that day all of the creatures of the forest gather around the snake and the frog as the snake prepares his tools and the anesthesia starts to kick in. All the creatures of the forest look on anxiously, knowing that in just few short moments they're either going to hear their friend's voice for the first time, or they're going to lose him forever. And you'll never guess what happened next.	Croaking!	0.012746632099151611

married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. .  Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented new machine that would transfer portion of the mother's labor pain to the baby's father. He was asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it. The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. However, as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point, they decided to try out for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer all the pain to him.

Several dropped and rolled down toward the fence. Anotherboy came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate. Sure enough, he heard, One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me .... Hejust knew what it was. He jumped back on his bike and rode off. Just around the bend, he met an old man with cane, hobbling along. Comehere quick, said the boy, you won't believe what heard! Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls! Theman said, Beat it, kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk. When the boy insisted though, the man hobbled slowly to the cemetery. Standingby the fence they heard, One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me. Theold man whispered, Boy, you've been tellin' me the truth. Let's see if we can see the Lord...? Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything.

frog is born mute .  frog is born mute so he can't make any noises that frog typically makes because, well, he can't make any noises at all. So naturally it's very difficult for the frog to make friends with the other frogs and he ends up with just one friend; tortoise who's had the patience and the wherewithal to befriend this mute frog and to develop system of communication with him. Basically the frog blinks once for Yes, twice for No, the tortoise does all the talking and asks all the questions and they get along just fine. Years go by and the frog and the tortoise have fostered beautiful friendship. But as the frog has gotten older he has become sexually curious and desires to mingle with the other frogs his age. The tortoise senses this one day and asks the frog, 'do you want me to take you to the pond?' The frog blinks once for Yes. So the tortoise takes the frog to the pond and starts introducing him to all the other frogs. At first the frog is very nervous but the tortoise does great job of explaining his disability and all the other frogs are very accepting of his condition. The mute frog ends up making lot of new friends which boosts his confidence. And then the frog spies across the pond beautiful girl frog. He can't take his eyes off of her and the tortoise catches him staring. The tortoise says, like her, don't you?' The frog blinks once. The tortoise says, want me to go talk to her for you?' The frog blinks twice for No. see,' says the tortoise. wish you could talk to her yourself.' The frog blinks once, single tear rolling down his little frog cheek. gee, my friend,' says the tortoise. been good friends for so long, think owe it to you to find way to restore your voice.' And with that the tortoise sets out. Thetortoise searches all over the forest for days until one day he meets snake who just so happened to be the most renowned surgeon of all the land. This snake could perform any surgery that exists. The tortoise explains the situation to the snake and asks him if there's anything the snake can do for the frog.' Yessssss,'the snake replies. issss one sssurgery can perform that may ressstore your friend'sss voice, but you have to undersssstand, it's very risssky. There'sss fifty percent chance your friend won't sssurvive the sssurgery.' my,' says the tortoise. be sure to let him know!' So the tortoise returns to the frog and tells him the news. this snake who might be able to restore your voice, but it's coin toss whether or not you survive the procedure. Do you want to go through with this?' After long pause, the frog blinks once for Yes. So day is set aside for the surgery and on that day all of the creatures of the forest gather around the snake and the frog as the snake prepares his tools and the anesthesia starts to kick in. All the creatures of the forest look on anxiously, knowing that in just few short moments they're either going to hear their friend's voice for the first time, or they're going to lose him forever. And you'll never guess what happened next.	Craking!	0.012746632099151611

Soon he was spotted by farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree. * Moralof the story:* Bullshitmight get you to the top, but it won't keep you there ** Lesson6** Alittle bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground into large field. While he was lying there, cow came by and dropped some dung on him. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was. The dung was actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him. * Moralof the story:*1. Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy2. Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend3.	And if you're dealing with a profound disaster, you'd be better off	0.0019324421882629395

frog is born mute .  frog is born mute so he can't make any noises that frog typically makes because, well, he can't make any noises at all. So naturally it's very difficult for the frog to make friends with the other frogs and he ends up with just one friend; tortoise who's had the patience and the wherewithal to befriend this mute frog and to develop system of communication with him. Basically the frog blinks once for Yes, twice for No, the tortoise does all the talking and asks all the questions and they get along just fine. Years go by and the frog and the tortoise have fostered beautiful friendship. But as the frog has gotten older he has become sexually curious and desires to mingle with the other frogs his age. The tortoise senses this one day and asks the frog, 'do you want me to take you to the pond?' The frog blinks once for Yes. So the tortoise takes the frog to the pond and starts introducing him to all the other frogs. At first the frog is very nervous but the tortoise does great job of explaining his disability and all the other frogs are very accepting of his condition. The mute frog ends up making lot of new friends which boosts his confidence. And then the frog spies across the pond beautiful girl frog. He can't take his eyes off of her and the tortoise catches him staring. The tortoise says, like her, don't you?' The frog blinks once. The tortoise says, want me to go talk to her for you?' The frog blinks twice for No. see,' says the tortoise. wish you could talk to her yourself.' The frog blinks once, single tear rolling down his little frog cheek. gee, my friend,' says the tortoise. been good friends for so long, think owe it to you to find way to restore your voice.' And with that the tortoise sets out. Thetortoise searches all over the forest for days until one day he meets snake who just so happened to be the most renowned surgeon of all the land. This snake could perform any surgery that exists. The tortoise explains the situation to the snake and asks him if there's anything the snake can do for the frog.' Yessssss,'the snake replies. issss one sssurgery can perform that may ressstore your friend'sss voice, but you have to undersssstand, it's very risssky. There'sss fifty percent chance your friend won't sssurvive the sssurgery.' my,' says the tortoise. be sure to let him know!' So the tortoise returns to the frog and tells him the news. this snake who might be able to restore your voice, but it's coin toss whether or not you survive the procedure. Do you want to go through with this?' After long pause, the frog blinks once for Yes. So day is set aside for the surgery and on that day all of the creatures of the forest gather around the snake and the frog as the snake prepares his tools and the anesthesia starts to kick in. All the creatures of the forest look on anxiously, knowing that in just few short moments they're either going to hear their friend's voice for the first time, or they're going to lose him forever.

married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. .  Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented new machine that would transfer portion of the mother's labor pain to the baby's father. He was asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it. The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. However, as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point, they decided to try out for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer all the pain to him. The wife delivered healthy baby with virtually no pain. She and her husband were ecstatic.	Mailman died on the porch.	0.998873770236969

I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them. Theelderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground. Thepoliceman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know. Afterabout half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is. So,as the couple passes, he says to them, Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?

Several dropped and rolled down toward the fence. Anotherboy came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery.

Just around the bend, he met an old man with cane, hobbling along. Comehere quick, said the boy, you won't believe what heard! Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls! Theman said, Beat it, kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk. When the boy insisted though, the man hobbled slowly to the cemetery. Standingby the fence they heard, One for you, one for me.

The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

The story of my rugby career .  was sitting at the bar enjoying drink to myself When next thing the door opened and in walked the most stunning woman I've ever laid eyes on. 5'11'' tall, stunning blue eyes, silky blonde hair, an hourglass figure. Barelycovered by tiny mini skirt and flimsy cotton top. could see she was not wearing bra and her incredibly firm breasts were on show. After watching her walk in turned back to my beer. No sooner had taken sip when turn to see her pulling another bar stool up close to me and sat down. She said and said in return. She asked how was and took my hand and placed it on her perfect inner thigh, rubbing it up and down. does that make you feel good ?' she asked. ..' I'llbet you feel good,' she continued. fact, I'll bet you've never felt this good before.'' Well,have,' corrected her. see, when was 17, was picked to play for the school 1st. in the National School Finals in front of crowd of about 3000 and felt really good.' Iimmediately felt bit pathetic saying that and thought she would get up and go. But she took my hand off her thigh and put it up the front of her top. Her nipple pushed into my palm as she massaged my hand into her pert, perfect breast.' Howdo you feel now,' she purred.' OK'replied. Again,she said, bet you do. In fact, I'll bet you've never felt good before!' Unbelievablyheard myself saying actually have. In that game, we were down by six points with about 20 seconds left in the match.

We were still behind by one point, but had simple kick at goal to win the match. Ahhh.... she growled between clenched teeth, more than bit miffed, pulled my hand from under her top and thrust it down the front of her skirt.

The story of my rugby career .  was sitting at the bar enjoying drink to myself When next thing the door opened and in walked the most stunning woman I've ever laid eyes on. 5'11'' tall, stunning blue eyes, silky blonde hair, an hourglass figure. Barelycovered by tiny mini skirt and flimsy cotton top. could see she was not wearing bra and her incredibly firm breasts were on show. After watching her walk in turned back to my beer. No sooner had taken sip when turn to see her pulling another bar stool up close to me and sat down. She said and said in return. She asked how was and took my hand and placed it on her perfect inner thigh, rubbing it up and down. does that make you feel good ?' she asked. ..' I'llbet you feel good,' she continued. fact, I'll bet you've never felt this good before.'' Well,have,' corrected her. see, when was 17, was picked to play for the school 1st. in the National School Finals in front of crowd of about 3000 and felt really good.' Iimmediately felt bit pathetic saying that and thought she would get up and go. But she took my hand off her thigh and put it up the front of her top. Her nipple pushed into my palm as she massaged my hand into her pert, perfect breast.' Howdo you feel now,' she purred.' OK'replied. Again,she said, bet you do. In fact, I'll bet you've never felt good before!' Unbelievablyheard myself saying actually have. In that game, we were down by six points with about 20 seconds left in the match. TheOpposition kicked the ball deep into our half of the field, where caught it. ran up field, side-stepping past the first few defenders, handed off couple of would-be tacklers, burst through few forwards, chipped over their fullback, regathered and scored try right under the posts with about or seconds 'til full time. We were still behind by one point, but had simple kick at goal to win the match. Ahhh.... she growled between clenched teeth, more than bit miffed, pulled my hand from under her top and thrust it down the front of her skirt. Myfingers immediately met what felt like wisp of soft cotton and she was wet whispered, tell me this, Mr. Rugby Man: Have you ever felt such perfect c*nt?''

Outraged,she immediately calls in the doctor. thought asked you not to tell anyone about my operation! Thesurgeon told her he had carried out her wish for confidentiality and that the first rose was from him: felt sad because you went through this all by yourself. Thesecond rose is from my nurse. She assisted me in the surgery and empathized because she had had the same procedure done some time ago. Andwhat about the third rose? she asked. Oh,that rose is from man upstairs in the burn unit.

Still my favorite joke ever made up. :) .  monocle walks into bar. After few drinks he starts to feel pretty good (and little uncoordinated). He reaches for cigarette, but the bartender stops him. Sorry, buddy, but due to city ordinances we don't allow smoking in here. You'll have to step outside to smoke. Sothe monocle hops off the bar stool and grabs his cigarettes to head outside. Meanwhile second monocle emerges from the bathroom. They bump into each other as they cross paths and fall to the floor, hopelessly entangled. They try to get free but the more they struggle, the more tangled they become. Thebartender looks down on this travesty and shakes his head. Hey you two! he shouts.

No Sex Tonight! .  I've never quite figured out why the sexual urges of men and women differ so much. Andnever have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing or why men think with their head and women with their heart. Forexample… One evening last week, my wife and were getting into bed. Well,the passion started to heat up, but then she said don't feel like it, just want you to hold me. Isaid What was that?! Soshe said the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear... You'rejust not in touch with my emotional needs as woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as man. Sheresponded to my puzzled look by saying, Can't you just love me for who am and not what do for you in the bedroom? Realizingthat nothing was going to happen that night, went to sleep. Thevery next day, opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to nice lunch and then went shopping at big, high-end department store. walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take so told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so said lets get pair for each outfit. We went on to the jewellery department where she picked out pair of diamond earrings. Letme tell you...she was so excited. She must have thought was one wave short of tsunami. started to think she was testing me because she asked for tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. But, think threw her for loop when said, That's fine, honey. Sheappeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, think this is all dear; let's go to the cashier. Icould hardly contain myself when blurted out, No honey, don't feel like it. Herface just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with baffled, then said Honey, just want you to this stuff for while. You'rejust not in touch with my financial means as man, enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as woman. Andjust when she had this look like she was going to kill me, added, Why can't you just love me for who am and not for the things buy you?	Apparently, no sex in the night!	0.0008170008659362793

Theman shrugs and says Well its funny story. you have probably heard the stories. was traveling around the orient and found this old oil lamp. figured might as give it shot and so rubbed it. All of the sudden this gorgeous genie comes out of the lamp and gives her whole spiel about wishes. Firstthing wished for was this roll of $20's that never ends. I'm still spending the thing. Works great. So for my second wish, asked for brand new Cadillac that becomes new again every year. Pretty great to always have brand new car. Problemis sort of hit brick wall and didn't know what else to wish for. thought for bit and told the genie 'well I'm not sure what else to wish for, but you are pretty hot. Want to fool around?' Thegenie responded hey it's your wish. But I'm just smoke from the waste down.	Not all that exciting stuff, what's the SOABABABORGHGHGH?	0.0007210373878479004

frog is born mute .  frog is born mute so he can't make any noises that frog typically makes because, well, he can't make any noises at all. So naturally it's very difficult for the frog to make friends with the other frogs and he ends up with just one friend; tortoise who's had the patience and the wherewithal to befriend this mute frog and to develop system of communication with him. Basically the frog blinks once for Yes, twice for No, the tortoise does all the talking and asks all the questions and they get along just fine. Years go by and the frog and the tortoise have fostered beautiful friendship. But as the frog has gotten older he has become sexually curious and desires to mingle with the other frogs his age. The tortoise senses this one day and asks the frog, 'do you want me to take you to the pond?' The frog blinks once for Yes. So the tortoise takes the frog to the pond and starts introducing him to all the other frogs. At first the frog is very nervous but the tortoise does great job of explaining his disability and all the other frogs are very accepting of his condition. The mute frog ends up making lot of new friends which boosts his confidence. And then the frog spies across the pond beautiful girl frog. He can't take his eyes off of her and the tortoise catches him staring. The tortoise says, like her, don't you?' The frog blinks once. The tortoise says, want me to go talk to her for you?' The frog blinks twice for No. see,' says the tortoise. wish you could talk to her yourself.' The frog blinks once, single tear rolling down his little frog cheek. gee, my friend,' says the tortoise. been good friends for so long, think owe it to you to find way to restore your voice.' And with that the tortoise sets out. Thetortoise searches all over the forest for days until one day he meets snake who just so happened to be the most renowned surgeon of all the land. This snake could perform any surgery that exists. The tortoise explains the situation to the snake and asks him if there's anything the snake can do for the frog.' Yessssss,'the snake replies. issss one sssurgery can perform that may ressstore your friend'sss voice, but you have to undersssstand, it's very risssky. There'sss fifty percent chance your friend won't sssurvive the sssurgery.' my,' says the tortoise. be sure to let him know!' So the tortoise returns to the frog and tells him the news. this snake who might be able to restore your voice, but it's coin toss whether or not you survive the procedure. Do you want to go through with this?' After long pause, the frog blinks once for Yes. So day is set aside for the surgery and on that day all of the creatures of the forest gather around the snake and the frog as the snake prepares his tools and the anesthesia starts to kick in. All the creatures of the forest look on anxiously, knowing that in just few short moments they're either going to hear their friend's voice for the first time, or they're going to lose him forever. And you'll never guess what happened next.	Craak!	0.012746632099151611

frog is born mute .  frog is born mute so he can't make any noises that frog typically makes because, well, he can't make any noises at all. So naturally it's very difficult for the frog to make friends with the other frogs and he ends up with just one friend; tortoise who's had the patience and the wherewithal to befriend this mute frog and to develop system of communication with him. Basically the frog blinks once for Yes, twice for No, the tortoise does all the talking and asks all the questions and they get along just fine. Years go by and the frog and the tortoise have fostered beautiful friendship. But as the frog has gotten older he has become sexually curious and desires to mingle with the other frogs his age. The tortoise senses this one day and asks the frog, 'do you want me to take you to the pond?' The frog blinks once for Yes. So the tortoise takes the frog to the pond and starts introducing him to all the other frogs. At first the frog is very nervous but the tortoise does great job of explaining his disability and all the other frogs are very accepting of his condition. The mute frog ends up making lot of new friends which boosts his confidence. And then the frog spies across the pond beautiful girl frog. He can't take his eyes off of her and the tortoise catches him staring. The tortoise says, like her, don't you?' The frog blinks once. The tortoise says, want me to go talk to her for you?' The frog blinks twice for No. see,' says the tortoise. wish you could talk to her yourself.' The frog blinks once, single tear rolling down his little frog cheek. gee, my friend,' says the tortoise. been good friends for so long, think owe it to you to find way to restore your voice.' And with that the tortoise sets out. Thetortoise searches all over the forest for days until one day he meets snake who just so happened to be the most renowned surgeon of all the land. This snake could perform any surgery that exists. The tortoise explains the situation to the snake and asks him if there's anything the snake can do for the frog.' Yessssss,'the snake replies. issss one sssurgery can perform that may ressstore your friend'sss voice, but you have to undersssstand, it's very risssky. There'sss fifty percent chance your friend won't sssurvive the sssurgery.' my,' says the tortoise. be sure to let him know!' So the tortoise returns to the frog and tells him the news. this snake who might be able to restore your voice, but it's coin toss whether or not you survive the procedure. Do you want to go through with this?' After long pause, the frog blinks once for Yes. So day is set aside for the surgery and on that day all of the creatures of the forest gather around the snake and the frog as the snake prepares his tools and the anesthesia starts to kick in. All the creatures of the forest look on anxiously, knowing that in just few short moments they're either going to hear their friend's voice for the first time, or they're going to lose him forever.

Suddenly, with no warning at all, he stands up, grabs the Chinese man by the neck, smashes his face against the bar and throws him to the floor. The Chinese man, dazed and angry, stands up and confronts the Jewish man. What the fuck is wrong with you?! Why would you do that?! TheJewish man looks him in the eye and says That was for bombing Pearl Harbor. TheChinese man froze. For bombing Pe- but that was the Japanese!! am Chinese! Japanese,Chinese, Korean, you're all the same to me, said the Jewish man. Dumbfounded, the Chinese man sits at the bar and orders another beer. He keeps eyeing the Jewish man, dark expression on his face. Suddenly, he grabs his beer mug and smashes it against the Jewish man's face, then proceeds to punch him and kick him until the Jewish man isn't moving any more. He sits back at the bar. After couple of minutes, the Jewish man struggles to his feet, stumbles to the bar, and confronts the Chinese man. What the fuck was that about? TheChinese man sips his beer, and without looking at the Jewish man, he says That was for sinking the Titanic. Outraged,the Jewish man goes red. Sinking the Ti- that was an iceberg!! TheChinese man shrugs.	The same goes for Goldberg, Goldberg, Rosenberg, Silberberg.	0.9988358616828918

Your duck is dead, replied the vet.. How can you be so sure? she protested. mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in coma or something. The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned few minutes later with black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. few minutes later he returned with cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat satback on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

small boy asks his Dad, Dad, what are politics? .  Dad says, Well son, let me try to explain it this way: I'm the breadwinner of the family, so let's call me Capitalism. Your mom, she's the administrator of the money, so we'll call her the Government. We're here to take care of your needs, so we'll call you the People. The nanny, we'll consider her the Working Class. And your baby brother, we'll call him the Future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense. So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. The little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room.

married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. .  Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented new machine that would transfer portion of the mother's labor pain to the baby's father. He was asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it. The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. However, as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point, they decided to try out for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer all the pain to him. The wife delivered healthy baby with virtually no pain. She and her husband were ecstatic.	The Mailer died on the porch when he got back.	0.9988917708396912

These three guys die together in tragic accident and they all go to heaven .  When they get there, St. Peter greets them and tells them, We only have one rule here in heaven. Don't step on the ducks. So,they enter heaven and sure enough, there are ducks all over the place. It'salmost impossible not to step on duck there's so many, and though they try their utmost to avoid standing on them, the first guy soon accidentally steps on one. St.Peter then appears with the ugliest woman the guy had ever seen. St.Peter chains the woman to the guy and says to him, Your punishment for stepping on duck is to spend eternity chained to this ugly woman! Thenext day, the second guy also accidentally steps on duck. Once again, St. Peter shows up and with him is another extremely ugly woman. He chains the woman to the second guy saying, Your punishment for stepping on duck is to spend eternity chained to this ugly woman! Thethird guy has observed all this and as he really doesn't want to be chained to an ugly woman for eternity, he's extremely careful where he steps. Indeed,he manages to go months without stepping on any ducks. One day though, St. Peterappears with the most gorgeous woman the guy has ever laid eyes on. She's tall, curvaceous, tanned and extremely sexy. Withoutword, St. Peter chains the woman to the third guy. Theguy happily says to the woman, wonder what did to deserve being chained to you for all eternity?	The woman's response had been no clue, but she had stepped into the pen.	0.9976361989974976
