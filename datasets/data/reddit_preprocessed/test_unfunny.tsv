A few minutes later, the jumper walks back into the bar.The other guy has to try it, too, so he orders a shot of tequila. He slams it and jumps out the window.

James is suffering from severe headaches. [Long] For as long as he can remember, he's had debilitating headaches that have hampered his life in every way. He finally seeks medical help. After some tests, the doctor returns:James, I don't know quite how to say this. It seems your testicles are pressing against the base of your spine, pinching a nerve and this is the direct cause of your pain. I'm afraid the only way to find relief is to have your testicles removed.James is reluctant, but concedes to the operation. After recovery, he feels outstanding.

Sure enough, fits like a dream.I could use a couple pairs of slacks tooOld man points to a rack, 34 inseam, what color you want?. James again is astounded. Son I told you, 40 years.How about some new dress shoes? Old man looks down, 12 wide coming up.How did you-40 years, the old man interrupts.James pays and is about to walk out when he mutters, you know, I could use some new underwear while I'm here.Old man hobbles over to the table as he says 38 waist.HA!

The story of my rugby career. I was sitting at the bar enjoying a drink to myself When next thing the door opened and in walked the most stunning woman I've ever laid eyes on. 5'11'' tall, stunning blue eyes, silky blonde hair, an hourglass figure.Barely covered by a tiny mini skirt and a flimsy cotton top. I could see she was not wearing a bra and her incredibly firm breasts were on show. After watching her walk in I turned back to my beer. No sooner had I taken a sip when I turn to see her pulling another bar stool up close to me and sat down. She said 'Hi', and I said 'Hi' in return. She asked how I was and took my hand and placed it on her perfect inner thigh, rubbing it up and down. 'So, does that make you feel good ?' she asked. ..'I'll bet you feel good,' she continued. 'In fact, I'll bet you've never felt this good before. ''Well, I have,' I corrected her. 'You see, when I was 17, I was picked to play for the school 1st. XV in the National School Finals in front of a crowd of about 3000 and I felt really good. 'I immediately felt a bit pathetic saying that and I thought she would get up and go. But she took my hand off her thigh and put it up the front of her top. Her nipple pushed into my palm as she massaged my hand into her pert, perfect breast. 'How do you feel now,' she purred. 'OK' I replied.Again, she said, 'I'll bet you do. In fact, I'll bet you've never felt THIS good before! 'Unbelievably I heard myself saying 'Well, actually I have. In that game, we were down by six points with about 20 seconds left in the match.The Opposition kicked the ball deep into our half of the field, where I caught it. I ran up field, side-stepping past the first few defenders, handed off a couple of would-be tacklers, burst through a few forwards, chipped over their fullback, regathered and scored a try right under the posts with about 2 or 3 seconds 'til full time. We were still behind by one point, but I had a simple kick at goal to win the match. Ahhh.... she growled between clenched teeth, more than a bit miffed, pulled my hand from under her top and thrust it down the front of her skirt.My fingers immediately met what felt like a wisp of soft cotton , and she was wet !She whispered, 'Well tell me this, Mr. Rugby Man: Have you ever felt such a perfect c*nt?
